Objective: 
Shoot for high 80%s for accuracy on the classification. Once reached, move to objective 2 of table detector project. 

Prediction: 
1. One model for class and high accuracy of submission.csv 
2. ** Extra ** probabilty of strenth to the class 

Ideas: 
LDA topic modeling 

UMAP finding - 
The environment and social classes appear closely correlated and there may be confusion from prediction models on these two classes

Considerations: 
how to predict? 
- whole page
- paragraph 
- sentence 
- word

do we predict a probabilty with a classification for strenth to the class? 
Example: Class Prediciton: Governance Probabilty: 78% strength to class
