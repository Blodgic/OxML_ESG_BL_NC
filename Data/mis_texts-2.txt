Processing   personal data while staying on top of the mounting compliance challenges of privacy and data protection is one of our founding   principles. As a service provider, we make individuals’ privacy and data security a priority for all of our products and services. This is   the reason why thousands of multinational enterprises and millions of employees, workers and consumers entrust ADP with their   personal data. As a company that complies with privacy legislation covering the personal data we hold for our own employees and   business contacts, we have embedded privacy principles within our processes. Data privacy throughout the organization ADP has developed a governance structure for our privacy program that ingrains  data privacy at every level of our organization and in every product we design.  This includes: •  Global Data Privacy team — Spearheads privacy efforts across our organization •  Privacy Leadership Council — Made up of cross-disciplinary professionals  including representatives from our business units •  Privacy Stewards — Designated business leaders that manage the controlled  processing of your personal data within each ADP business unit and function Our Global Privacy Program is essential to our approach to protecting our  Clients’ data and revolves around the following privacy principles: •  Ethics in Artificial Intelligence  As outlined in our Ethics in AI position statement, we have adopted a set of  principles and processes to govern our ethical use of newer technologies such  as artificial intelligence or machine learning. •  Privacy by Design  Privacy principles are hardcoded within the ADP business model. We prioritize  privacy and data protection at every stage as we design and develop new   products and services. •  Transparency and notice  ADP publishes Privacy Statements to inform our associates, business   contacts, client employees, workers, and job applicants as to how their   personal data is collected and for which purposes it will be processed. •  Data Minimization and Access Control  We collect and use only essential personal data necessary to achieve the  business purpose for which data was collected. While ADP processes personal  data, internal access to data is granted based on role and job function. •  Documented Data Processing Activities  We perform data flow mapping and privacy assessments on our data processing  activities, enabling us to hold an inventory of our processing activities. •  Standardized Record Information Management  At ADP, our record retention schedules govern the proper retention for  every category of record that ADP maintains and when the records should be  destroyed. •  Incident Management Process  Our incident response process is designed to ensure that any information   security incidents are addressed promptly and effectively, in accordance with  ADP security policies, procedures and legal requirements. •  Supervision of Third-Party Providers  ADP vendors must contractually comply with our data security and privacy  standards.

 unique_linebreakIntroduction  Our Communities  Our People  Our Environment  Business Ethics and Governance  SASB Index ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH Maintaining the highest levels of integrity and  standards of business conduct is a requirement  of all organizations that represent Aris Gold. Our  Business Conduct and Ethics Policy and Anti- Bribery and Corruption Policy collectively form  our Code of Conduct (the “Code”). All directors,  officers, employees, contractors and suppliers  must undergo a certification process that confirms  they agree to comply with the Code. These  requirements and expectations in our Supplier  Code of Conduct extend to those who conduct  business on our behalf; suppliers are required to  read, understand and comply with both the Code  of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct. Our formal ethics program ensures we have a  strong culture of transparency, accountability  and integrity, and helps to prevent and avoid  violations of the law or our Code of Conduct by  employees and suppliers. Our due diligence, undertaken in the  procurement process, supports our Ethics, Audit  and Compliance functions, and identifies any  potential corruption and conflicts of interest risks  prior to engaging in a business relationship with a  third party. Our Whistleblower Policy states that any person  concerned about the possibility of business  conduct that is illegal, unethical or contrary to the  policies of Aris Gold is encouraged to report  alleged violations or complaints by contacting the  Board’s Audit Committee in writing or submitting  the complaint or concern through our online  whistleblower platform. ANTI-CORRUPTION Although Aris Gold has measures to prevent  corruption or bribery, our operation in Colombia  presents risks of corruption and fraud, particularly  during procurement activities, the land acquisition  process and when committing and contributing  to social investments. Colombia scores 39 out  of 92 on Transparency International’s Corruption  Perception Index (CPI) and our Marmato mine is in  a remote area where goods and services are often  procured from smaller suppliers through informal  channels. Given these factors, we conduct regular  training with employees and require suppliers  to sign compliance agreements to ensure they  understand the laws, regulations and company  policies related to ethical business conduct and  anti-corruption.  PAYMENT OF TAXES AND ROYALTIES  Transparency and accountability over how  revenue from mining operations is used to  benefit all citizens is a key component to building  trust and understanding. As a publicly traded  company in Canada, Aris Gold is required to  annually disclose payments to foreign and  domestic governments under the Extractive  Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA)  beginning with our 2021 ESTMA report which  was filed in 2022. ESTMA requires reporting  on the payments of any taxes, royalties, fees,  production entitlements, bonuses, dividends,  infrastructure improvements and any other  prescribed payments over CAD$100,000. 2021 PERFORMANCE To date, we have not received any complaints  through our whistleblower platform that relate  to matters of illegal or unethical conduct  or other matters relating to fraud against  stakeholders of the company. A Money Laundering and Financial Terrorism Risk  Management System in accordance with the new  Colombian requirement, Sistema de Autocontrol  y Gestión Integral del Riesgo de Lavado  de Activos, de Financiación del Terrorismo  (SAGRILAFT) was implemented. SAGRILAFT  requires companies operating in Colombia to  implement SAGRILAFT’s management system  and training that manages the risk of money  laundering and financing terrorism. Enhancements to our employee training  program included increasing an understanding  of international and national laws and ensuring  compliance with SAGRILAFT. 2022 PRIORITIES In 2022, Aris Gold will ensure  compliance and ethics standards at  Soto Norte are consistent with its  company policies. 35 Aris Gold 2021 Sustainability Report 
 unique_linebreakIntroduction  Our Communities  Our People  Our Environment  Business Ethics and Governance  SASB Index ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING (ASM) MANAGEMENT APPROACH Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a  traditional and important livelihood in many  areas of Colombia; however, ASM outside our  mining leases can pose significant security, safety  and environmental risks to our communities and  our people. There is a significant ASM community around   the Marmato mine, numbering close to   3,000 individuals. Significant ASM activities also  exist in the surrounding territories of Cabecera,   El Llano and Echandia, and while not the  predominant activity, ASM is a livelihood for   some who live in Cabras and San Juan.  Depending on the techniques used, ASM  activities conducted without regulatory approval  can increase the risk of mass landslides and  cause significant harm to human health and the  environment due to the use of toxic chemicals,  such as mercury, in processing. ASM activities  also pose several risks to Aris Gold’s operations.  ASM miners who gain unauthorized access to our  mine can compromise structures and equipment,  which may lead to interruptions in production,  impact our workers’ safety and affect our ability to  conduct business. Aris Gold aims to manage these  risks while recognizing ASM’s importance for the  livelihoods of the people who live near our mine. 2021 PERFORMANCE  In 2021, there was improved communication  with the ASM community in an effort to work  harmoniously with respect to mitigating  environmental impacts. As part of the roundtable  discussions, we established a formal dialogue  process with local government officials and a  select group of approximately 20 artisanal miners,  representing the broader group. Further, there  was participation by representatives of the  Association of Traditional Miners of Marmato  when we socialized potential projects to be  carried out by the company. We were able to work with the ASMs to address  risk situations that were identified in the area: one  situation was related to effluent entering the river  in the traditional Villonza mine and the second one  was the closure of a work front due to a landslide  in the El Palo mine located in an upper level mine.  Additionally, a request for information was made  by the Echandía Miners Association, relating to  blocked access to the Echandía tunnel. 2022 PRIORITIES It is our hope to continue to work with  the ASM community and create regular  opportunities to discuss traditional  mining and the modern business of  mining in the municipality. Through the  activation of the Mining-Environmental  Roundtable of Marmato, with  participation of associations, mining  companies, academics, environmental  authorities and other voices that  can contribute their knowledge,  we will strive for safe, productive  and environmentally responsible  practices so that all parties can  safely mine in the area.

 unique_linebreakTSR condition  Relative TSR has a weighting of 33.33% and will be compared to  performance against the TSR peer group, namely the companies  listed on the RESI 10 as at the preceding December of the offer. The peer group listed companies included on RESI 10 as at  December 2021 were: • Anglo American Plc • Anglo American Platinum Ltd • AngloGold Ashanti Ltd • BHP Billiton Group Plc • Glencore Plc • Gold Fields Ltd • Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd • Northam Platinum Ltd • Sasol Ltd • Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd Exxaro’s TSR, for the purposes of this plan, is defined as the  compound annual growth rate (CAGR) on a portfolio of Exxaro’s  ordinary shares purchased in December preceding the grant,  holding the shares and reinvesting the dividends received from the  portfolio in Exxaro shares until the end of the performance period,  and then selling the portfolio on that day. The monthly TSR calculation will be performed using the dividend  payments and Reuters share price data on the nearest trading day  to 31 December preceding the award and the nearest trading day to  31 December at the end of the performance period, and computing  the compound annual growth rate between these values. The TSR will be smoothed by computing the TSR in the same  manner for the three-year period following each trading month for  the six months preceding 31 December of the award, which means  that the TSR is computed from: • Grant date to end date (one month) • Grant date to end date (two months) • Grant date to end date (three months) • Grant date to end date (six months) The TSRs computed in this manner will then be arithmetically  averaged to yield the final “smoothed TSR” for the TSR  performance condition. The smoothed TSR for each member of the peer group will be  computed over the same period in the same manner. This period of  smoothing is in line with the market. If the TSR of Exxaro over the three-year period is equal to the  minimum TSR target, the minimum LTIP award (50% of the TSR  portion of the grant) vests. If the Exxaro TSR is equal to or greater than the maximum TSR  target, then 100% of the grant will vest. The award vests linearly between 50% and 100% for performance  between the minimum TSR target and the maximum TSR target. The TSR targets for the LTIP grant are: • The minimum TSR target is equal to at least the median position  of the smoothed TSR of the peer group over the three-year  period • The smoothed TSR of the peer group will be the simple average  not weighted on a market capitalisation basis • The maximum TSR target is equal to the top three TSR of the  peer group returns over the three-year period The remuneration committee has the discretion to make  adjustments to the method of computation of the TSR for the peer  group and for Exxaro. Under the rules of the plan, the remuneration  committee may vary the TSR condition if events occur that would  make such a variation necessary or desirable or would make the  amended performance condition a fairer measure of performance. Achievement of ESG targets  ESG targets have a weighting of 33.34%. The targets will be  measured in terms of the approved strategic dashboard used to  monitor achievement of the business strategy: • The targets will be measured as per the FTSE Russell index  including international resource peer companies • A 50% to 100% vesting sliding scale will apply for an annual ESG  rating between the median percentile ranking (50% vesting) and  the upper quartile percentile ranking (100%) • The average performance over the three-year period will be  measured The table below summarises the performance vesting conditions  applicable to the 2021 awards. Performance vesting conditions Performance vesting condition Weight (%) Vesting of awards (after year three) ROCE 33.33 17% ROCE achievement will result in 50% vesting (threshold) 19% ROCE achievement will result in 90% vesting (target) 22% ROCE achievement will result in 100% vesting (stretched) TSR 33.33 Median TSR peer group position will result in 50% vesting Top three TSR peer group position will result in 100% vesting ESG as per FTSE Russell index 33.34 Median ranking will result in 50% vesting Upper quartile ranking will result in 100% vesting Where the actual performance falls between the stated ranges, linear interpolation will be applied between the stated vesting points.

 unique_linebreakSupply Chain and Product Stewardship Strategic objectives:  Generate net positive impact  from our operations   ESG Priority: Supply chain and product  stewardship Inside Supply chain and  product stewardship It is imperative to understand and man- age the risks present in diverse and  dynamic supply chains, and to ensure  that DPM works with suppliers that  share our values and goals in relation  to social and societal wellbeing and  environmental protection. It is neces- sary to ensure an adequate level of  metal accounting and traceability, both  of valuable and deleterious elements,  throughout our organization. Our Approach Our Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics is among DPM’s guiding ESG  policies. The Code covers every party  related to our operations. The Code is a  statement of the key principles and ex- pectations that guide our business, and  the behaviour of anyone who works for  or does business with DPM. This is ful- ly aligned with DPM’s six core values.  Locally managed procurement pro- cedures take into account not only the  cost and quality of goods and services  sought, but also the health, safety and  environmental policies of current and  prospective suppliers. At a minimum,  we stipulate in contracts that selected  suppliers must comply with local laws  and regulations. In addition we are  compliant with the EBRD Performance  Requirements and our internal manage- ment system is designed to drive compli- ance by our partners as well. Third-Party Due Diligence  (“3PDD”) Process DPM has several other initiatives  aimed at mitigating the risks of brib- ery and corruption. A key remediation  measure, identified as a result of our  comprehensive anti-bribery and cor- ruption risk assessment completed in  2016, was establishing a risk-based  third-party due diligence (“3PDD”)  process. A cross functional team, in- cluding representatives from the cor- porate office and sites, as well as ex- ternal consultants, worked to develop  our 3PDD process, along with an au- tomated tool to support it. Our 3PDD  Standard was implemented across the  organisation in 2017. Part of this pro- cess includes screening all potential  suppliers through a global risk intelli- gence network. As a minimum, we stip- ulate and evaluate that suppliers must  comply with local human rights, and  labour laws and regulations. Product Stewardship In 2019, we started applying the 3PDD  process downstream of our operations,  as DPM has begun screening smelt- ers that buy and/or process our con- centrates as well as the buyers of our  sulphuric acid on their environmental,  health, safety and social policies and  performance. We also receive extensive  questionnaires based on conflict miner- als legislation in both the EU and USA. Future Outlook   Supply chain and product stewardship  are among the topics that we plan to  develop over the next several years.  We will continue to strengthen our  processes upstream and downstream  in our value chain, including the due  diligence steps and continuing compli- ance monitoring.

At ADP, security is integral to our products, our business processes, and infrastructure. We use and deliver advanced services and  technology for data security, data privacy, fraud prevention, and crisis management. ADP’s converged security organization has dedicated teams of security   specialists who monitor for cyber security threats, fraud attempts and   business resilience incidents 24/7/365 to proactively assist in addressing  issues before they escalate. ADP provides the advantages of a global industry-leading advanced platform  defense, intelligent detection, automated data protection, fraud defense,   identity and access management, and so much more. By embedding multiple  layers of protection into our products, business processes, and infrastructure,  security remains a priority for our business. By collaborating with key government  and industry partnerships, memberships and alliances, ADP uses threat-led  intelligence to stay ahead of the risks. WISE – Women in Security Enterprises As part of ADP’s Diversity & Inclusion strategy, we try to create diverse teams  across all facets of our operations. This can be particularly difficult for divisions  that are traditionally male dominated. Our Global Security Organization (GSO)  recognized this challenge and created Women in Security Enterprises (W.I.S.E.)  to better engage with ADP’s security-focused female associates. The W.I.S.E.  program seeks to connect women in security-related fields to empower and  support each other in advancing their careers. The program has grown to include  almost 90 associates in its first year, and is poised to expand in the near future. Business continuity With the world experiencing unrivaled uncertainty and disruptions due to  COVID-19, ADP’s commitment to keeping services and operations running  smoothly is essential, now more than ever. Our goal is to identify and mitigate  any technological, environmental, process, or health risks that may prevent  the delivery of our products and services to our clients. To accomplish this, we  expanded upon our Business Resiliency Program, an integrated framework that  establishes our mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery process.

We understand that operational closure, concurrent rehabilitation, and land management activities directly connect employees, communities,  the environment, government and infrastructure. We are committed to: • Ensuring operational closure is inclusive and within legal framework parameters • Proactively managing environmental impacts to minimise residual liabilities • Leaving a positive legacy of alternative sustainable land use for employees and local communities • Allocating financial resources required to ensure process conclusion • Managing Exxaro’s land according to agreed strategy Our land management goals for 2021 included transferring 90% of post-mining land to emerging farmers in local communities by 2026.  We continued to create strategic partnerships with farmers to advance agri-economies in support of government’s land redistribution policies. Integrated stages of mining and mine closure planning Operational closure, concurrent rehabilitation and land management are part of Exxaro’s operating philosophy and moral responsibility.  We actively plan our operations with closure in mind, ensuring adequate financial resources are available to meet our rehabilitation  commitments.

 unique_linebreakDIAMONDBACK ENERGY /// 2022 CSR  15 ENVIRONMENT E N V I R O N M E N T We are committed to developing our resources sustainably and minimizing the environmental impact of our operations. We are dedicated to performing these duties in compliance with applicable federal,  state and local laws, including laws regulating emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane. We take actions beyond those required by law to reduce emissions and freshwater use, and make significant  investments in infrastructure to reduce our environmental impact.  Environmental Management Our environmental, health and safety (EHS) management system provides the  framework through which we identify, monitor and reduce environmental risks.  Our executive management team sets our sustainability and business strategies,  approves goals, provides resources to meet performance targets and has oversight  of our sustainability, including our Environmental Management approach. Our  Board of Directors, through the SSCR Committee maintains ultimate oversight. We utilize our EHS system to track environmental performance, including maximiz- ing response to flaring events, methane leaks and spills. This tool provides trend  data to our management and operational teams, enabling proactive oversight and  corrective action to achieve continuous improvement.  Our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, includ- ing those related to waste handling and remediation of hazardous substances,  water discharge and air emissions. We complete compliance audits for all newly  acquired facilities in accordance with the Texas Environmental, Health, and Safety  Audit Privilege Act.  In 2021, we made an incremental investment in our team by adding additional staff  to our Environmental Management group. As part of our environmental programs,  we provide training to our employees in our operating procedures and compliance.  We continually investigate, evaluate and incorporate BACT, wherever feasible, to  reduce or prevent adverse environmental impacts from our operations.  Our annual short-term incentive compensation opportunity for all employees  throughout the Company includes metrics regarding achievement of our environ- mental responsibility targets. This compensation change was expanded in 2021 to a  20% weighting and again in 2022 to 25%.   Energy Use and Emissions Diamondback is committed to reducing our energy consumption and lowering its  greenhouse gas emissions. We implement various emissions controls, detection and  repair objectives in order to honor this commitment.  In 2021, we trialed four different technology systems to establish continuous mon- itoring and response in our operations. Data collection and alarm capabilities allow  us to rapidly identify and respond to leaks associated with equipment malfunction  or failure prior to an extended release. The data we collect from these systems  enables us to enact preventative maintenance plans.  Our goal is to implement real-time continuous monitoring of emissions to cover  at least 90% of operated oil production by the end of 2023. As of April 30, 2022,  approximately 70% of operated oil production was under continuous monitoring.  To monitor our facilities for fugitive emissions, we have implemented a wide range  of practices including on-the-ground inspections, dedicated field staff who use  Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) cameras to monitor our assets daily and repair any  leaks identified and flame sensor technology for real-time monitoring.  Our team is focused on our 2022 goal of less than 1% flaring and frequently comes  within that range. Our internal auditing program provides additional reinforcement  of these practices. Electrification of Combustion Sources We are expanding our use of electricity-powered compressors, which emit less GHG  compared to natural-gas-fueled equipment. In 2021, we successfully moved over 75  megawatts from generated power to high line power. In Q1 2022, we drilled our first  well on electricity supplied directly from power lines instead of through a generator.  We expect to expand this program into 2023 wherever feasible. We use renewable energy in the form of solar-powered pumps for chemical deliv- ery, automated valves (where appropriate) and lighting. We are currently exploring  opportunities for more solar installations throughout our operating fields to meet  our electricity needs with renewable power. 
 unique_linebreakGOVERNANCE CEO MESSAGE INNOVATION ASSOCIATES COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT INDICES HIGHLIGHTS COMMITMENT TO ESG 2020 Global Corporate Social Responsibility Report •  40 Paper Since our core business revolves around payroll and HR services, paper waste  has historically been a significant component of our environmental footprint.  After recognizing the opportunity to reduce waste for both our clients and our  own business, we started to offer digitized services and launched paper waste  reduction initiatives. Within North America, approximately 85% of clients were  paperless in 2019. Construction debris ADP continues to require construction debris from ADP projects be recycled. In 2019, ADP did not have any new building greenfield construction projects.  Some locations were vacated, moved and/or upgraded. During the decommission  process, workstations and unsalvageable furniture (that could not be donated)  were recycled. Plastic, aluminum and glass recycling All ADP buildings include designated recycling containers and we encourage all  associates to manage their waste by using the proper receptacle responsibly. Recycling awareness campaign As the new BEGreen branding unfolded, our Corporate Real Estate team   partnered with another cross-functional team and Brand Marketing to create  new, simple signage to remind associates that ADP recycles. Our goal is to  increase recycling of plastics, metals and glass and decrease trash co-mingling  with recyclables in trash bins. New signage was also placed at shred bins, encouraging all paper to be recycled.  We often think of shred bins for confidential information only. However, ADP  arranged with our shred vendor to recycle all paper placed in the shred bin —  confidential or otherwise, including newspapers, magazines, pictures, paper file  folders and more. Coffee pod recycling At many of our locations, ADP offers filtered water and hot beverages to our  associates. In 2019, we introduced a program to collect and recycle “freshpacks”  used in single-cup machines for hot beverages. The freshpack contents are   composted while the freshpacks are sold and used to create objects such as park  benches and tables. In 2019, ADP US recycled 22 tons or 1.3 million freshpacks! Electronic waste ADP partners with an electronic waste recycler and reseller to reuse or recycle  our electronic waste components. Prior to recycling, all data is wiped from the  electronics, then returned to the vendor when the lease expires. In 2019, ADP  recycled 230 tons of electronic waste. Gift-in-kind donations In 2019, ADP continued to donate furniture and office supplies no longer  needed to nonprofit organizations. In 2019, through our Project Refresh, we  donated 3,049 items valued at $111,000, resulting in the diversion of nine tons  of waste in the United States. Cafeteria sustainable products Per our policy, ADP requires our cafeterias and bistros to use sustainable products  whenever possible. Disposable serviceware is made from biodegradable materials,  and cutlery is made from recycled plastics. Three of our cafeterias have Food  Waste Pulping Machines, reducing our waste volume. In 2019, we continued to  prohibit all Styrofoam products and began recycling all cooking grease. Waste Management 
 unique_linebreakIn this regard, some of the specific measures adopted included: • The establishment of a task team of functional and technical  representatives, nominated by leadership, to review the  design and define job families, sub-streams and organisational  capabilities to better cluster jobs • The revision of the structured development policy and associated  policies to ensure that it supported career progression • The documentation of key principles that govern the fair pay  implementation programme for consistent application and  longevity In light of work-from-home employment condition changes, the  committee monitored the equipping and change management  efforts undertaken to address cybersecurity and other risks. 3. Oversee the implementation of the stakeholder  engagement strategy and KAM of the eight identified  stakeholder groupings Unable to make in-person visits, as is preferred, the committee  with management undertook multi-level, multi-region, virtual  engagement sessions, which were conducted over a period of five  days and a Capital Markets Day. The advantage afforded by the  virtual platform was the integration of simultaneous engagement  with community and government stakeholders, which contributed  to a richness in discussions. A number of learnings were gleaned  and actions identified. Relationship building is a key outcome of the stakeholder  engagement strategy in redressing the plight of the poor in the  communities surrounding the operations. Progress in respect  of COVID-19-related delays in SLP delivery were at the heart of  discussions aimed at turnaround implementation plans. At the end  of the third quarter, the organisation was 8% behind schedule and  16% under budget spend. The committee is overseeing planned  improvements in the delivery of community development projects  and the efforts to meet commitments under lowered COVID-19  lockdown levels. The committee’s oversight of stakeholder engagement includes  weekly reports in respect of business activity and media review as  an indicator of reputation management.  4. Monitor the ESD programme execution and targets  achievement The ESD programme execution and targets will receive ongoing  focused attention in 2022 as part of the Sustainable Growth and  Impact strategy.     Detailed information and positive results are reported on  pages 112 and 113. The committee remains committed to ESD  and its monitoring. 5. Review the ongoing anti-bribery and corruption  programme implementation, including the rolling out  of the conflict of interest programme and ensuring an  ethical culture The group’s ethics processes are managed by the management  ethics committee, which comprises prescribed officers,  representatives of the internal audit and the chief audit officer.  Chaired by the chief risk officer, it meets either monthly or as  required to consider issues of non-compliance to the group code of  ethics or conflicts of interest policy as well as matters reported on  the ethics hotline or to management. Social, ethics and responsibility   committee report continued Required investigations are conducted by a dedicated forensic team  that reports its findings independently to the chief audit executive.  The ethics committee formally reports to this committee to ensure  the board has full oversight of ethics-related matters. During the period under review, the group revised its insider dealing  and external communications policies. The committee oversaw this  revision with the support of the audit committee as well as the RBR  committee. These revised policies were approved by the board for  implementation from 3 June 2021. Key innovations implemented during the year in review have  assisted with the automation, improved access and dissemination  of company policy and awareness training. The ongoing digital  innovation and process improvements in respect of conflicts of  interest, and all company policies in general, continue into 2022.  It is anticipated to contribute positively to the ethics management  plan, which is in the process of formulation following the detailed  ethics risk assessment undertaken in the third and fourth quarters  of 2021. The ongoing anti-bribery and anti-corruption programme  encompasses the identification and combating of at least two  different forms of bribery-related activity especially when engaging  the state or organs of state as one of our stakeholders, and when  engaging suppliers or vendors of goods and services.  Contractors, vendors and third parties are also made aware  during the process of engagement with the group that they are  also expected to report corrupt activity when identified. The  mechanisms to do so are written into contracts and published  on our website, and made visible by the use of posters.   During 2021, the company implemented compulsory anti-bribery  and anti-corruption awareness training. All employees and  identified contractors were required to complete the revised  training on principles of fraud and corruption. It is a requirement  that all employees have a thorough understanding of these  concepts, how to prevent such practices and how to respond  when such practices are brought to their attention.  6. Ensure ESG is levered to build long-term competitive  advantage, enhance resilience to sustainability risks and  attract socially conscious investors, talent and customers Sustainable Growth and Impact strategy Exxaro’s Sustainable Growth and Impact strategy is an integrated  socio-economic development strategy in response to the dual  challenges of social inequality (aggravated by COVID-19) and the  systemic and additive impacts of climate change (and increasing  biodiversity losses) and aims to transition Exxaro to a low-carbon  future. The committee, along with management, dedicated time to  ensuring delivery in respect of SLP commitments and developing  the Sustainable Growth and Impact strategy. The intent of the Sustainable Growth and Impact strategy is aimed  at changing the quality of life of people, the natural environment  and economies in coal mining and windfarm areas.  Health, safety and integrated wellness Health and safety-related reporting in respect of the COVID-19  pandemic was elevated to the board but, in keeping with the  committee’s mandate, all particulars in respect of policy, funding  and other related decisions were submitted for the committee’s  attention. 178 Exxaro Resources Limited Environmental, social and governance report 2021

Diamondback’s involvement in trade  associations and related working groups and committees also creates valuable  opportunities to enhance our overall ESG strategy and to promote important edu- cational and public advocacy initiatives.  Our participation in trade associations is subject to management oversight by our  Senior Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs, who serves as the  principal Diamondback representative in such associations. When Diamondback  decides to join a trade association, we do so because we believe the association  generally represents our best interest. Trade associations often represent a diverse  membership of companies operating in different states, or on federal lands, and  their policy views may not always be representative of Diamondback’s views, or  applicable to Diamondback. We annually review our trade association member- ships to ensure they continue to serve our business needs. We pay regular membership dues to several trade associations that are organized  under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. For such organizations to  which our annual membership dues total more than $25,000, Diamondback   annually inquires and makes reasonable efforts to obtain information on  what portions of our membership dues may be used for lobbying activities.  Diamondback disclosed its 2021 trade association dues where the payments   were more than $25,000 and the percentage of such dues used for lobbying   activities in a report on our website. Below is a list of Diamondback’s 2021 trade association memberships: »  American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC) »  American Petroleum Institute (API) »  Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) »  Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA) »  Permian Strategic Partnership (PSP) »  Texas Oil and Gas Association (TXOGA) »  Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) We are committed to transparency about the Company’s public policy advo- cacy efforts, political contributions and related activities. The SSCR Committee is  responsible for reviewing and discussing with Company management our public  policy advocacy efforts and annually reviews the activities of our political action  committees and all political contributions made with corporate funds.  We published our first annual 2020 Corporate Political Contribution Disclosure  Report in 2021. In 2021, the Center for Political Accountability assessed our politi- cal contribution disclosures for its annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political  Disclosure and Accountability and designated the Company a first-tier score of  84%. Also, we were recognized as one of the most improved companies for politi- cal contribution disclosures in 2021. The Company updates the Corporate Political  Contribution Disclosure Report annually, and we encourage you to review our  2021 Corporate Political Contribution Disclosure Report and our Policy Governing  Corporate Political Contributions, which are both available on our website. 
 unique_linebreakAudit committee report The committee is governed by its terms of reference that codify  its roles and responsibilities. To assist the board of directors,  the committee plays an essential role in providing independent  oversight over the following: • Quality and integrity of the financial statements and related  public announcements • Integrity and content of the integrated reporting process • Qualification and independence of the external auditor • Scope and effectiveness of the external audit function • Scope and effectiveness of the overall combined/integrated  assurance process • Effectiveness of the internal controls and internal audit function • Integrity and efficacy of the risk management process relating  specifically to internal controls and financial reporting risks  through assurance over the system controls and policies in place The committee’s terms of reference were reviewed by external  assurance providers, and are aligned with legislation, regulations  and King IV. COMPOSITION  The committee members are elected annually by the shareholders  at the AGM on recommendation by the board of directors (via  the remuneration and nomination committee). The board of  directors ensures, through its recommendations, that there is a  balanced blend of skills and experience, with specific focus on  financial literacy, to enable the committee to discharge its function.  Members of this committee consist only of independent non- executive directors. For the year under review, the committee consistently had four  independent non-executive directors. The board of directors  is satisfied that the committee members have the necessary  academic qualifications or experience in economics, law, corporate  governance, finance, accounting, commerce, industry, public affairs  or human resource management. In this regard, Chanda Nxumalo was appointed as a new member  to the committee at the 2021 AGM as the first female director  to become a member of the audit committee. The CEO, CEO designate and FD, together with members of the  executive team and senior management representing areas  relevant to the discussions at the audit committee, as well as the  independent external auditor, the chief audit officer and chief risk  officer, attend meetings either by standing invitation or as and  when required. The internal and external auditors have unrestricted  access to the audit committee.  ROLE AND PURPOSE The committee is an independent, statutory committee whose  members are appointed annually by Exxaro’s shareholders  in compliance with section 94 of the Companies Act and the  principles of good governance. In terms of the Companies Act,  this committee has an independent role with accountability to  the board and shareholders. The committee does not assume  the functions of management, which remain the responsibility of  the executive directors, prescribed officers and other members  of senior management, nor does it assume accountability of the  functions performed by other committees of the board of directors.  In addition to the Companies Act, the committee’s duties are  guided by the JSE Listings Requirements, King IV and its terms  of reference.

 unique_linebreakIntroduction  Our Communities  Our People  Our Environment  Business Ethics and Governance  SASB Index EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH As Aris Gold grows, we will continue to prioritize  a workplace that attracts individuals with diverse  and specialized skills, and those who want to  commit to our values and objectives. We aim  to grow our talented workforce by training and  developing our people in all areas of the business  to ensure our success as a mining and exploration  company, while helping our workforce fulfill their  personal career goals.  To accomplish this, we offer a range of  experiences, growth opportunities and benefits,  provide fair and equitable compensation, and  protect workers’ rights. We also aim to train and  recruit as many employees from the Caldas region  as possible and we are proud that currently   81% of employees are from here.  Our training programs are designed to build a  high-performance team that supports business  continuity, stability, profitability, efficiencies and  continuous improvement. Training will also allow  for succession into critical roles and long-term  economic benefits for individuals of our host  community, the Caldas region and Colombia,  more broadly.  We support our employees’ right to freedom  of association and engaging in the collective  bargaining process. Aris Gold has a collective  bargaining agreement with two labour unions,  namely, Sintramienergetica Seccional Marmato  and Sintramineros Seccional Marmato with  580 and 129 Aris Gold employee members,  respectively. In total, 1,068 workers are part of  the collective agreement which includes benefits  such as healthcare, education allowances, loans  for vehicles, housing and education, subsidies for  medicine, mutual savings plans and life insurance.  It also includes a social bonus fund, which consists  of contributions from Aris Gold and union  members. Fund distributions go toward helping  community members in need. 2021 PERFORMANCE In 2021, there was a company restructuring  that resulted in downsizing by 350 employees  and resulted in a strain on the company due to  the resources required to address employee  claims. All but three claims were settled by  the end of 2021. The formal process to assess  workforce performance and identify high- potential employees was not advanced in 2021  due to the attention given to the company’s  restructuring plan. We recognize that our relationship with the  labour unions can be further enhanced. We  will seek further clarity about their needs  through new channels and regular in-person  meetings in order for us to collaboratively  develop solutions and solve our differences.  The insights learned through constructive  discussions drive positive change. In 2021, we  rolled out a new 14/7 shift structure to replace  6/1 shifts allowing for more concentrated work  time and better productivity and better work- life balance. Along with this new arrangement,  employees gained additional benefits such as  housing, laundry and meals at no cost.  To improve disclosure about worker benefits,  various communication campaigns were  developed during the year as well as the  publication and distribution of three issues  of the Somos Caldas newspaper where all  employee benefits were also communicated.  An employee satisfaction survey was  conducted with a test group of 513 employees  to first understand if we are addressing  relevant issues and concerns of employees. 87%  of permanent  employees   are from the   Caldas region Aris Gold 2021 Sustainability Report 25 Aris Gold 2021 Sustainability Report 
 unique_linebreakBROADCOM   2022 ESG Report |   Governance 48 Fostering a Speak-Up Culture We strive to create an environment where employees  can speak openly about our business practices, including  ESG-related matters, and we encourage our employees  to ask questions and raise concerns. We have an Open  Door Policy and make it very clear that retaliation for  raising a concern in good faith or reporting questionable  behavior or possible misconduct in good faith is  prohibited. Employee Ethical Culture Survey We conduct an annual Employee Ethical Culture  Survey with an external firm to better understand our  employees’ engagement in and perception of our ethics  and compliance culture and to find areas where we can  continuously improve. Through this survey, we know that our employees are  aware of our ethics and compliance program and have  confidence in and trust our management. In 2022, we  again scored above the external firm’s company peer  group benchmark in all categories that were surveyed. Anti-Corruption We prohibit our directors, officers, employees and  anyone acting on our behalf from engaging in corruption  and bribery. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy  is summarized in our Code, including the rules and  procedures for providing or accepting gifts, meals and  entertainment. Internal Audit, with our Compliance Team, regularly  assess our operations for corruption risks, including  conducting audits of our distributors and resellers  and on our partner program. Our Compliance Team  conducts anti-corruption diligence on our new suppliers,  distributors and resellers before onboarding them and  on companies and businesses before we acquire them. In addition, our Compliance Team and Internal Audit  work with an external firm to biennially review our anti- bribery and anti-corruption compliance program. The  results and recommendations from the biennial review  are discussed with the Audit Committee and reported to  the Board. 95.3%  BELIEVE THE CONDUCT, VALUES AND  COMMUNICATION OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES  ARE HONEST AND ETHICAL 98.1%  ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE EFFORTS OF  THE COMPLIANCE TEAM 95.3%  BELIEVE THE COMMUNICATION, TRAINING  AND SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE  COMPLIANCE TEAM ARE EFFECTIVE IN OUR 2022 EMPLOYEE ETHICAL  CULTURE SURVEY Ethics and Compliance Trainings We require our employees and contractors to complete  annual trainings that support Broadcom’s values and  culture, including our Code, bullying and harassment  prevention, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, protection of  confidential information, data privacy and security, human  rights, insider trading prevention, conflicts of interest and  anti-competition prevention, as applicable. We also require our employee and contractors to certify  that they understand and agree to abide by the applicable  Broadcom policies, including our Code and Anti-Bribery and  Anti-Corruption Policy, when they complete their trainings. 100%  OF OUR EMPLOYEES COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL  COMPLIANCE TRAINING FOR 2022 
 unique_linebreak2021 Arista Corporate Responsibility Report  | 26 We are committed to maintaining the highest level of professional  and ethical standards in the conduct of our business around  the world. Our reputation for honesty, integrity, and fair dealing  is an important component of our success and the personal  satisfaction of our employees. Ethical behavior is the cornerstone  to a company’s well-earned success. We’ve set policies and  procedures in place to ensure that our operations, employees, and  suppliers are held to rigorous standards regarding their conduct  and compliance with expectations and regulations. Business  with Integrity CODE OF CONDUCT Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct  defines these standards, providing a roadmap  for behavior that aligns with our company’s  values and the Arista Way and our Code of  Ethics and Business Conduct is reviewed  annually. Per the Code, employees are  prohibited from receiving, offering, promising,  authorizing, directing, or making any bribes,  kickbacks, or payments of money or anything  of value to obtain an improper business or any  other advantage for Arista. We also strictly  prohibit giving money or anything of value  directly or indirectly to a government official for  the purpose of corruptly influencing a foreign  government. To underline compliance with  these requirements, employees participate  in annual training on Arista’s Anti-Corruption  Compliance Policy and Code of Ethics and  Business Conduct.  ANTI-CORRUPTION We are committed to complying with  applicable international and domestic anti- corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K.  Bribery Act. Our Anti-Corruption Compliance  Policy and Guidelines outline the parameters  of what is acceptable and what is not  permissible from an anti-corruption point of  view. Companies like Arista can be held liable  for the bribery acts of third parties, including  commercial intermediaries and other agent  representatives and joint venture partners.  To ward against these activities, we have  established procedures for conducting due  diligence on channel partners engaging  in international sales, and manufacturers,  suppliers, logistics providers, customs agents  and other third parties that may be directly or  indirectly interacting with foreign officials on  our behalf.  ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR We rigorously observe applicable antitrust  or competition laws of all countries or  organizations. Under our Code of Ethics  and Business Conduct, anti-competitive  agreements are prohibited.  WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY Our Whistleblower Policy encourages  transparency, facilitates confidentiality,  ensures appropriate handling of complaints,  and provides multiple avenues for employees  and non-employees alike to submit concerns  around accounting or auditing matters via   our whistleblower website (www.arista. ethicspoint.com), and our ethical/violation  hotline (telephone numbers available at   www.arista.ethicspoint.com). As of this report’s  publication, there are no pending litigation  matters alleging anti-competitive behavior or  antitrust violations by Arista. TRAINING Arista conducts compliance training with  our employees annually on a variety of  topics, including our Arista’s Anti-Corruption  Compliance Policy, Code of Ethics and  Business Conduct, data privacy, cybersecurity,  and harassment prevention. CYBERSECURITY Our internal risk management teams oversee  compliance with applicable laws and  regulations and coordinate with subject matter  experts throughout the business to identify,  monitor and mitigate risk including information  security risk management and cyber defense  programs. These teams maintain testing  programs and provide updates to the Audit  Committee and the Board. Arista also has an  information security program that incorporates  multiple layers of physical, logical and  written controls. Arista leverages encryption  configurations and technologies on its  systems, devices, and third-party connections. Arista performs an enterprise risk assessment  that is reviewed by the audit committee on  an annual basis and monitored on a quarterly  basis by the audit committee. The enterprise  risk assessment is an assessment of key   risks, including information security risks,   data privacy, supply chain, human capital,   and others.  1 | About Us                       2 | Environment                     3 | Social Responsibility            4 | Supply Chain 5 | Governance                     6 | Goal Progress APPENDIX

Counterparty and dealer limits The committee approved the revised dealer and counterparty limits  for the group’s treasury operations in the financial markets.  Group governance framework The committee was intimately involved in finalising the revised  group governance framework and energy delegation of authority to  ensure that the energy business is governed effectively and fit for  purpose.  Internal audit findings and forensic investigations The committee ensured that corrective measures were put in place  where internal control deficiencies were identified by internal audit  or through forensic investigations. The committee will continue to  monitor the efficacy of these measures. Transition of internal and external auditors The committee continuously monitored the transition plans for the  outgoing and incoming external and internal auditors to ensure  seamless transition. CEO and FD management representation letter The committee authorised the CEO and FD to sign the management  representation letter for the interim and final period. Other key issues Other key issues that received attention during the year included,  among others, the following: • The going concern statement and solvency and liquidity  assessment in terms of sections 46 and 48 of the Companies Act  as at 30 June 2021 and 31 December 2021 • Financial results and dividend declarations for the six-month  period ended 30 June 2021 and the year ended 31 December 2021 • Trading statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2021  and the year ended 31 December 2021 • Valuation of group carrying amounts in respect of various  investments at 30 June 2021 and 31 December 2021 • Noting of annual financial statements of major subsidiaries  (as defined by the JSE Listings Requirements) within the Exxaro  group of companies • New and revised accounting standards and pronouncements  brought to the attention of the committee for consideration • Revised group treasury risk management and hedging policy KEY FOCUS AREAS The below table shows the key focus areas for the committee. 2021 STATUS Review the strategy in relation to deployment of new post-modern ERP solutions to ensure acceptable cost, risk and  alignment with the Exxaro strategy Ongoing Ensure alignment of the combined assurance process, internal audit plan and external audit plan based on a risk- based approach Achieved Review Exxaro’s future strategy relations to insurance cover and self-insurance, taking into account global resistance  to thermal coal and insurance markets Ongoing Oversee the project plan for financial and risk-based disclosures in terms of Exxaro’s aim to comply with TCFD Achieved Approve the levels of materiality to be used for internal audit (including the audit protocols and the classification of  findings) and consider levels of materiality for the independent auditor Achieved Oversee the transition plans for the internal and external audit functions Achieved PERFORMANCE EVALUATION There is currently neither a legal nor regulatory requirement for the committee to complete annual performance evaluations and, while  King IV recommends regular performance evaluations for all board committees, it has become governance practice for Exxaro to have the  committee’s performance and effectiveness evaluated every two years.  As Exxaro’s board committees embarked on a significant transformation journey in 2020, which culminated in the group governance  framework, revised delegation of authority, board committee mandate and work plan review as well as committee name changes following this  process. Allowing an opportunity for the changes to settle and make impact, the board did not undertake a review in 2021 following the high- level assessment in 2020 but will commence formal performance evaluations in November 2022 for disclosure in the integrated report 2022. CONCLUSION The committee, in carrying out its duties, has due regard to its terms of reference, the Companies Act, the JSE Listings Requirements, and  the principles and recommended practices of King IV. The committee is satisfied that it has considered and discharged its responsibilities  in accordance with its terms of reference and confirms that it has fulfilled its mandate and responsibilities in terms of the Companies Act, the  JSE Listings Requirements and King IV. The committee would like to thank management for all the hard work during these unprecedented times and circumstances.

 unique_linebreakHuman Rights  Strategic objectives:  Generate net positive impact  of our operations   ESG Priority: Sustainable and resilient  communities Inside Human Rights Metals and mining companies face  additional community and employ- ee-related risks when operating in con- flict zones and in areas with weak or  absent governance institutions, rule of  law, and legislation to protect human  rights. They also face risks when oper- ating in areas with vulnerable commu- nities, such as indigenous peoples or  ethnic minorities.  Our Approach It is an integral part of DPM’s Corpo- rate Responsibility Policy to respect  human rights and avoid contributing to  adverse human rights impacts.  DPM has a new Human Rights  Standard that came into force on 1  January 2020. Our new Standard  has under its scope all our corpo- rate business functions, employ- ees, contractors and third-party  representatives. It is informed by the  United Nations Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, UN Guiding Princi- ples on Business and Human Rights,  UN Declaration on Rights of Indige- nous People, Voluntary Principles on  Security and Human Rights. None of  our operations have been subject to  external human rights reviews or im- pact assessments, and our external  security personnel, whether they are  DPM employees or contracted to  DPM, must comply with our Code and  all other Corporate policies. Periodically, we conduct a comprehen- sive internal Human Rights Compliance  Assessment (HRCA) developed by the  Danish Institute for Human Rights. The  last full assessment in 2016 highlighted  the need for a human rights commitment  at the corporate level and a stand-alone  human rights policy/standard across  our organisation. Our commitment to  protecting human rights was incorporat- ed into Corporate Responsibility Policy  and a separate corporate-level Human  Rights Standard was developed. Hu- man Rights screening is incorporated  into our risk based third-party due dili- gence 3PDD Process. All employees can communicate  grievances related to human rights  through our corporate-wide Speak  Up and Reporting Policy which pro- vides a confidential and anonymous  method for reporting. Future Outlook We will work to make sure our Human  Rights Standard is properly applied in  all of our operations. DUNDEE PRECIOUS METALS | Sustainability Report 2020 32

In the past, we donated acreage  and funded a new volunteer fire department  location outside of Midland, Texas. We have also  provided personal protective equipment (PPE) and  monetary donations to regional fire departments  to close their funding gap for equipment  purchases, vehicle repairs, and upgrades.  In 2020, Callon supported fire departments in  four counties throughout our asset base. Funding  was spent on much-needed equipment repairs,  upgrades, and PPE requirements.  Callon Cares Committees We believe corporate stewardship is both a  financial obligation and a social duty. Callon has  established Callon Cares Committees comprised  of local employees in our field locations to  guide regional philanthropic efforts through  volunteerism, donations, and leadership.   Our Permian Callon Cares Committee has  brought employees and families together  for bowling and a school supply drive for  Communities in School. They have also  supported Habitat for Humanity and West Texas  Food Bank with donations and volunteers, and  made financial contributions to the Midland  Education Foundation and other organizations.  In 2020, the committee hosted a mask and  school supply drive for a local elementary   school,  collected  supplies  and  personal  essentials for foster care facilities and senior  citizens, and sponsored a food drive for the local  food pantry. Our Eagle Ford employees have been long- standing, active members of LEPCs (local  emergency planning committees) in several  counties, enabling them to build relationships  with first responders and maintain readiness  for emergencies. Through their extensive  community connections, the Eagle Ford Callon  Cares Committee can address a variety of local  needs, such as providing Christmas gifts for at- risk children. In Houston, our employees donated surplus  pantry items to the Memorial Hermann  Emergency Room staff and EMTs in support  of their overnight shift staff in 2020.  We also  sponsored meals for our local county hospitals.  Our philanthropy program also includes a  charitable matching program for our employees  who  contribute  to  registered  nonprofit  organizations. As our employees donate, so does  Callon. Our Charitable Contribution Company  Matching Program matches approved employee  contributions made to qualifying organizations  up to $1,000 annually. This program was  launched in 2019, and as of January 2021, we  have distributed over $70,000 in matching  funds to over 85 organizations. Callon will continue to value the perspectives of  our community stakeholders and strive to be a  good neighbor. The children loved their gifts.

 unique_linebreakBest Practice  03 Why is it important? Our Approach KEPCO E&C has established a system designed to periodically check and  improve sustainability-related issues through its ESG Committee and its  non-executive directors. In the process, we allow employees to observe BOD  meetings to promote the rights and interests of more diverse stakeholders.  Furthermore, we have strengthened our ethical/compliance management  by conducting the in-house integrity survey and blocking factors that cause  corruption in advance to ensure transparent management activities. As such,  KEPCO E&C will lay more solid foundations for sustainable growth based on a  system of checks and balances. Stability and transparency of corporate operation are important  to stakeholders such as suppliers, employees, and shareholders  since they are directly related to corporate sustainability. KEPCO  E&C recognizes its impact on its stakeholders and thus conducts its  business activities with greater integrity and responsibility by practicing  ethical/compliance management. To ensure a more sustainable future,  we intend to respond flexibly to the rapidly changing energy industry  by continuously identifying new growth businesses and effectively  managing business risks.

 unique_linebreakDigital transformation at a tipping point Resolving digital dilemmas As organizations work out their digital business strategies, new  tensions and dilemmas are arising between the “art of the possible”  and the “art of the permissible”. In our groundbreaking report, Journey 2022 - Resolving Digital Dilemmas,  published in 2018, we identify these complications as Digital Dilemmas.  Many of these dilemmas go to the very heart of what it means for  humans to interact with an increasingly connected digital world. We group the sources of Digital Dilemmas into three interlinked  dimensions of tension: Insights – how do we share and leverage data analytics? Questions of  trust and truth become critical. Inertia – how do we react to personal and societal misgivings about the  implications of technology? What is the business response when the real  world is unwilling or unable to change at the pace of digital innovation? [GRI 102-15] Digital technologies have brought levels of transformation and value  that were once thought unimaginable. In many ways we have moved  to an era of “digital by default” where those services that can go digital  have done, even though the associated opportunities and disruptions  can be as challenging as they are exciting. Keeping up with this ever-changing digital world is not always easy.  Having adapted their strategies towards e.g. migrating to the Cloud,  businesses are now faced with the opportunities and challenges  posed by the adoption of maturing technologies such as artificial  intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and automation.  As the digital and physical worlds converge and become ever more  interconnected, we will see new and far-reaching economic, social and  ethical implications.  Technology is evolving so fast that in many areas regulators are  struggling to keep pace, with the result that some deeply embedded  social values could be threatened. Security, safety and privacy risks  are proliferating at an individual and an enterprise level. From online  platforms and social media to cryptocurrencies and the gig economy,  digital business processes and models may actually bring as many  dilemmas as they do opportunities. In this new world, an assumption of “digital by default” no longer  cuts it. The digital “art of the possible” has to be tempered with  considerations of the “art of the permissible” in terms of what society,  and we as good corporate citizens see as being true to the values  we all hold dear. More than ever, companies need to address major  questions of fairness, morality and ethics if they want their business  models to be genuinely sustainable and acceptable to business  partners, customers and employees. Market Trends For companies and public organizations alike, the digital agenda has reached a  turning point. Corporate Digital Responsibility Shareholder Value Diversity & Inclusion Great Place to Work Support for New Start-ups Climate Change Energy Saving Community Support Health & Well-being Sustainable Supply Chain Only by appropriately addressing these concerns can a company  take full advantage of the possibilities of AI, robotics, automation and  other breakthrough technologies. Successful business strategies  must master a whole new paradigm of responsibility that extends far  beyond the scope of traditional environmental, societal and well-being  considerations – one that embraces a completely new perspective  on Corporate Digital Responsibility. But it’s not all just about  technology - more than 40% of business leaders see their greatest  digital transformational challenge as one of culture and skills*.  By being at the forefront of sustainable digital transformation Atos is  uniquely positioned to help clients identify and master their challenges  and opportunities. At a time when sustainability and responsibility  are more critical than ever before to the long-term success of any  organization, Atos is committed to helping its clients surf the next  digital wave, so they make the right choices and investments to  ensure their future well-being and growth.  Inequalities – what happens when digital business models do not bring  mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders? Maintaining balance in this system are Ideals. These reflect the  individual and corporate values, beliefs and ethical standards that help  define the boundaries of acceptability and trust for technology and  business models. A company’s Ideals will shape its digital future. The approach that  businesses take to resolving their identified dilemmas will influence the  very DNA of their enterprise.

 unique_linebreak2929 As a business with a diverse portfolio, the context of exactly  what safety must look like can vary across our enterprise.  Each of our divisions measures performance specific to their  industries. When reported and managed, these metrics help  us to better understand the causes of our incidents and  reduce the chance of them happening again. There was a  58 per cent increase in proactive reporting in our Canadian  natural gas division, including reports of both hazard  identification and near misses. In 2021—and similar to previous years—the majority of incidents  were related to individual slips, trips and falls or musculoskeletal  injuries. We are continuing to improve our management  systems, implement training initiatives and engaging our  employees through a variety of preventative measures.  Our Australian safety team offers the Soft Tissue Intervention  Program, where a physiotherapist ascertains workplace and  job-task risks. This preventative work also includes ergonomic  assessments and education to support keeping people  healthy. Coupled with the “Move Safe” pilot program in our  Canadian utilities, which involves stretching and exercising to  prevent injuries, soft tissue injuries have declined. Leader training is another important prevention strategy.  About 75 per cent of our utilities leaders have completed the  Safety Excellence for Supervisors and Managers program,  with sessions continuing into 2022. This comprehensive  program focuses on how leaders can effectively engage their  team members to influence positive safety behaviours.  Public safety We all play a role in keeping the public safe from overhead  powerlines and underground natural gas pipelines, and we  take our responsibility in that social contract very seriously.  We engage and educate stakeholders, as well as mark  buried lines that pose an inherent danger to those who work  near them. We are always looking for new ways to engage  the public so they understand they must be vigilant when  working around energy infrastructure. Public safety is not just about how we work or how we  support our customers—it’s also about supporting the  contractors and businesses that are critical to delivering  safe and reliable products and services. In our natural gas  division, we participated in over 400 industry meetings,  200 contractor meetings and 100 damage prevention  meetings, a substantial increase from 2020, to discuss safe  digging practices near natural gas lines.  In partnership with SpaceLab, an internal space where  we collaborate and execute innovative projects, we have  developed a new automated tool that analyzes incoming  public requests for underground pipeline locations to predict  the likelihood that a proposed activity will lead to an incident.  Our outreach and education efforts resulted in the highest  number of “locate” requests we have ever received for gas  lines from industrial, commercial and residential building and  development activities. There was a slight increase in gas  line hits in 2021, but still one of the lowest numbers recorded  after 2019’s and 2020’s performance. In our electricity  division, the number of powerline contacts overhead and  underground was largely consistent with 2020. 75% of our utilities leaders have completed Safety  Excellence for Supervisors and Managers program  with sessions continuing into 2022 A central hub for utility safety A significant change in 2021 was the merger of three  agencies that focused on different aspects of public  safety around utilities. Alberta One-Call, Alberta  Common Ground Alliance and the Joint Utility Safety  Team have come together to become Utility Safety  Partners. Bringing together the resources of three  similar programs into one powerhouse will allow for  greater collaboration and impact. 1.5 line hits per 1,000 locates—below the Alberta provincial average 
 unique_linebreak12 ENVIRONMENT 12 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  TABLE OF CONTENTS 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Goal Setting Process Dolby is committed to setting ambitious and  achievable goals for reducing our carbon footprint.   In 2021, we launched a goal setting process to   develop near-term GHG reduction goals in   alignment with the most recent climate science.  We are using the Science Based Targets initiative   (SBTi) criteria version 5.0 to inform our goal setting  process. This consists of forecasting business-as- usual growth against SBT requirements and modeling  emission reduction opportunities to assess feasibility.  For Scopes 1 and 2, we identified achieving 100%  renewable electricity across our operations and  pursuing facility electrification at our major natural  gas-consuming sites as the primary and secondary  opportunities to further our goal of driving these  emissions down to near zero by 2025. For Scope 3, emissions reduction assessments are  currently concentrating on Purchased Goods and  Services (including Capital Goods), the Use of Sold  Products and Business Travel, our largest sources of  Scope 3 emissions in our 2019 baseline year. To further understand our Scope 3 emissions, a  supplier emissions assessment was initiated to  evaluate which suppliers to include in engagement  and goal setting strategies. We are also looking into  opportunities to increase the energy efficiency of our  products and work with our customers on renewable  energy procurement. Additionally, we are educating  employees and implementing tools to encourage and  facilitate sustainable business travel. A number of evaluations are underway, and we aim to  finalize our goals by the end of calendar year 2022.

In 2021, we are planning to continue this work, whilst also  deepening the financial analysis of climate risks with more  detail and publishing our updated integrated climate policy,  which includes a description of unified approaches to  scenario analysis, as well as our assessment and  management of our carbon footprint and climate risks. Monitoring permafrost thaw We document a full list of risks in our climate risk register.  Thawing of permafrost is considered one of the most critical  risks due to its potential impact on our physical infrastructure.  For example, destabilising building foundations could result   in bearing capacity failure and deformation of building  structures, unacceptable operating conditions or complete  collapse of buildings and structures, leading to economic   and environmental damage and potentially injury or loss of  life. Other risks to our operations associated with permafrost  thawing include reduced operational time of winter roads   and ice crossings, and increased water levels during floods  or longer flooding seasons. We mitigate against these risks by regular monitoring and  compliance with design, construction and operational  regulations. Monitoring includes field observations of the  condition of foundation soils, the temperature regime inside  buildings and building structure movements. Upon detecting  any signs of thawing of permafrost ground and hazardous  defects in building structures, we inform all involved parties and  take appropriate measures to remediate. We have a particular  focus on the safety of fuel storage facilities and to this end: • all storage facilities are designed to take into account  permafrost, with raw materials selected for permafrost  conditions; • we conduct regular external and internal monitoring  of facilities; • we apply a strict zero-tolerance approach to any regulatory  deviations at potentially environmentally hazardous facilities; • the logistics of fuel and lubricants supply is carefully  planned to determine optimal minimum storage volumes;  • emergency drills are carried out for fuel spill scenarios. Energy efficiency By optimising the energy efficiency of our operations, we  realise cost and carbon savings, whilst also embracing a   low carbon economy. Our Climate and Energy Management  Systems, alongside our Carbon Management Policy, include  regular energy audits and site-level projects. Each year, we  update our Energy Efficiency Programme, which involves  monitoring, metering and reduction initiatives, in line with  ISO 50001 international standard for energy management.  Green financing  Part of our strategy to achieve our climate goals involves  raising $280 million in green and sustainability-linked  loans, which are earmarked specifically for our transition  projects. These funds now comprise 16% of our overall  debt outstanding and tie us to meeting specific targets,  including implementing a comprehensive climate  management system. Since linking our ING credit facility to a Sustainalytics  rating in 2018, we have now launched our first Green  Financing Framework, agreeing a $125 million Green   Loan with Societe Generale to finance investments in  low-carbon transition. The aim is to attract long-term   ESG financing and to facilitate transparency, disclosure,  Green financing  project category Eligible projects Clean transport  • Electric vehicles • Low carbon haulage systems and  machinery (electricity sourced from  the grid network sourcing hydropower) Renewable energy  • Solar photovoltaic energy generation  plants  • Wind energy generation plants Energy efficiency • Projects with the purpose of improving  energy efficiency of operational units  sourcing energy from grid Pollution prevention  and control • Water and wastewater treatment/ purification (See our case study on  reverse osmosis at Voro on page 48) • Water treatment facilities aiming to  improve water reuse rate and minimise  discharge of water pollutants  • Dry stacking storage  • Waste sorting, recycling and reuse integrity and quality in Polymetal’s green loans for  interested investors and stakeholders.  Our Green Financing Framework was developed in line  with the Loan Market Association’s Green Loan Principles  and received a second opinion rating of Medium Green  from CICERO, with a governance score of Good. The  seven-year green loan under the Green Financing  Framework is the first Green Loan Principles-compliant  loan in the gold mining sector globally and is expected to  be the first in a portfolio of eligible green projects that will  reduce our carbon footprint. 3,586 GJ of renewable energy generated, reducing our GHG  emissions by 686 t of CO2e 29% of heat reused Our key areas of focus are:  • complying with all applicable regulatory requirements   at a minimum; • actively reducing our carbon footprint or improving  energy efficiency through innovation, including low- carbon and renewable energy solutions; • embedding energy efficiency into new project design,  technology updates and in equipment procurement  processes; • engaging employees through establishment and  nurturing of a culture of energy efficiency; and • extending our energy-conscious approach to our  suppliers, investors and wider stakeholders.  We deploy heat recovery technology to convert wasted  heat from diesel generation and processing plants into  electricity and heat for other premises. In 2020, 29% of   our total heat requirements were met by heat recovery.   We also look at digital and AI solutions that can help  increase resource efficiency and decrease GHG emissions. Renewable energy Renewable energy plays a crucial role in our low-carbon  transition strategy, whilst also being critical to our energy  security at remote mining sites. We have enabled solar  photovoltaic generation at our Svetloye mine, and plan   to launch two major renewable power plants at Omolon  (2.5 MW in 2021) and Kyzyl (5–10 MW in 2022), as well as  additional smaller plants at other sites. By 2025, our target   is for 7% of our electricity requirements to be met from  renewable sources. In 2020, the proportion stood at 0.4%. As we switch from diesel to grid energy at many remote  facilities, we are working with energy suppliers to increase  42  Polymetal International plc Sustainability Report 2020 Sustainability Report 2020 Polymetal International plc 43 OVERVIEW MATERIAL ISSUES ASSURANCE AND DISCLOSURE

For the 2018 reporting cycle, the 2018 emissions factors have  been utilised as opposed to the 2017 factors. In previous years  the emissions factors used for the Group’s greenhouse gas  emissions reporting have been a year behind, mainly due to the  factors not being released in time for half year assurance (for  example, 2016 emissions factors used for 2017 reporting cycle).  Going forward, the emissions factors used will coincide with  the year of the reporting cycle as these are the latest factors  available for the majority of the Group’s reporting period. The CO2e associated with carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous  oxide is reported. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with  hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride  are estimated to be immaterial to total emissions and are,  therefore, not reported. The principal record of the Group’s worldwide facilities is its  legal department’s Global Property Database. Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily calculated from  energy consumption records reported via the Group’s global  environmental database. Where actual usage data is not  available for facilities and residences within the Global Property  Database, an estimated consumption is used based on the type  of building. Greenhouse gas emissions related to business travel include air  travel data for the majority of the global business and rail data  for business units operating in the UK and US. These data are  taken from travel suppliers’ procurement records. Emissions from joint ventures and pension scheme properties  not occupied by the Group are not included. Where a business  or facility is acquired during a reporting year, it will be included  in our reporting in the next full reporting year after the change. The Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol ‘market-based’ method have been  calculated as 533,031 tonnes CO2e. Supplier-specific emission  factors have been sought for our most significant operating  regions, but were either deemed of insufficient quality to use  at present or were unavailable. Therefore, in line with the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, this figure has been  calculated using residual-mix emission factors where available  for our UK, US and Swedish operations. In our other significant  operating regions, residual-mix emission factors are either  unavailable or the resulting absolute emissions at Group level  are within the margin of error and, therefore, country-specific  emissions factors have been used in line with the GHG  Protocol Guidance. 1. See summary of Deloitte LLP assurance below. 2. Excluding share of equity accounted investments. Metrics and targets  Due to the differences in geography and  function, each business unit implements its  own environmental goals and initiatives which  broadly focus on materials resilience, energy  and climate change, and waste, emissions  and discharges. In all cases, we aim for the  efficient use of resources and a reduction in  waste across the full lifecycle of our products,  from design through to manufacturing, use  and end-of-life.  As a business, we are continually improving  energy efficiency and de-carbonising  our energy supply to reduce greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions. In the 12 months  to 31 October 2018, Group-wide  GHG emissions have decreased by 2%.  In 2018 our ten largest sites accounted  for approximately 68% of total energy  consumption. All of these sites operate an  environmental management system, with  100% certified to ISO* 14001, with an aim  to reduce their energy consumption and in  turn direct and indirect GHG emissions. A full  Basis of Reporting on our GHG emissions is  available on our website.  2019 priorities We will continue to drive improvements  in the management of materials and  resources across all businesses and will  develop our environmental policy further  alongside progressing our alignment to  the UN Sustainable Development Goals. *International Organisation for Standardization. 34 BAE Systems Annual Report 2018 Responsible sourcing and impact  How our business works  continued
