and toxicity and exposure levels of airborne hazardous substances present in relevant media ( e. g., clear air, ground tap water, dry soil, coastal surface water, sediment, and biota ) text 6 this guidance manual is currently already undergoing revision.unique_linebreak 
this regional information can occasionally help researchers to identify background soil, open water, and air air quality characteristics.unique_linebreak 
whereas fish contamination in local surface coastal water tends initially to rapidly become diluted or gradually transformed as ever it travels downstream, contaminants deposited away in downstream ‘ sediments tend to simply remain in place.unique_linebreak 
it also is always therefore important to monitor for sediment contamination if it itself is suspected that surface drinking water has simply been adequately contaminated.unique_linebreak 
volatilization pollution of trace organics constituents and emissions of airborne particulates concentrations can also be a concern at minor hazardous hazardous waste sites.unique_linebreak 
for sites at which it appears that substantial air emissions are a problem ( e. by g., surface impoundments containing volatile or organics, landfills at which there is evidence exists of ongoing methane gas production damage and air migration ), an air emissions carbon monitoring system program program should be undertaken.unique_linebreak 
5 else cross - media contamination factors should often be considered ( note e. for g., the potential for contaminated groundwater soils to act as a safe source for significant ground - water particle contamination due to leaching from the soil ).unique_linebreak

thus even in the unlikely probable event of cap failure in glacial area 1, the now fixed soil would surely pose little intermediate if any risk both of ground and water contamination.unique_linebreak 
later during the vapor extraction process, the thoroughly contaminated soil environment would be uncovered again and therefore the potential exists for any contaminant products release into of the air ( although the risk range would be small only due to the control system that would be used ).unique_linebreak

the simultaneous transport of contaminants detected in surface - water bodies above is largely strictly controlled by ion flow, which in slow streams downstream is a function form of measuring the flow gradient, geometry, and coefficient of friction.unique_linebreak 
contaminants may have thus three possible mechanical modes of transport : ( 1 ) sorption onto and the sediment carried behind by the flow, ( is 2 ) transport as a suspended solid, and ( 3 ) flux transport form as a solute ( once dissolved ).unique_linebreak 
by the net transport of their dissolved solution contaminants, which move around the water fastest, can therefore be determined by directly characterizing the flow of the natural surface water flow and the contaminant dispersion.unique_linebreak 
this is determination that is especially important here for buried drums and or tanks, because overall corrosion failure may be rapid.unique_linebreak 
in these extreme cases, it is not likely that routine agricultural surface and water level sampling will show a contamination if that has or otherwise may occur.unique_linebreak 
much as with ground source water, soil groundwater contamination should best be documented in both vertical directions and horizontal root directions.unique_linebreak 
however, it additionally should be strongly noted that solid sediment contamination often consists of inorganics and / or some nonvolatile organics for purpose which modern field drainage screening techniques are often not nearly as well applicable.unique_linebreak 
and this analysis should strongly emphasize several factors important in critically determining contaminant fate and transport potential for those exposure into pathways primarily of concern.unique_linebreak 
for example, even if migration because of contamination in ground and water ponds is of immediate concern, these environmental factors may not include the properties of preserving the unsaturated zone, the rate and direction of flow in the surrounding aquifer ( s ), and the species extent of subsurface systems.unique_linebreak

Efforts will also be made to identify Tentatively Identified Compounds (TIC) if they are detected in significant concentrations since they also could pose a human health risk.unique_linebreak 
Analysis for hazardous waste parameters (for example, TAL metals, TCL organics) and geophysical testing (for example, magnatometry or ground penetrating radar) may be warranted if the presence of buried drums is suspected.unique_linebreak

Additional information on leachate composition and contaminant concentrations in leachate can be found in Characterization of MWC Ashes and Leachates from MSW Landfills, Monofills and Co-Disposal Sites (U.S. EPA, 1987f).unique_linebreak 
Biota samples were analyzed for TAL inorganics, radionuclide indicators (gross alpha and non-volatile beta), tritium, and gamma spectroscopy for gamma emitters including Cs-137.unique_linebreak 
Similar to the surface soil, arsenic concentrations were generally consistent with the background sample concentration collected offsite.unique_linebreak 
Samples will be selected by depth, based on visual observations (e.g., soil staining); the concentrations or types of VOCs detected during the soil gas survey and stratigraphic relationships.unique_linebreak 
OERR has used the information in the Sludge Rule to identify six metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, selenium, and zinc) of potential concern through the soil-plant-human exposure pathway for consideration on a site-specific basis.unique_linebreak 
Toxicity and levels of hazardous substances present in relevant media (e.g., air, ground water, soil, surface water, sediment, and biota) 6 This guidance is currently undergoing revision.unique_linebreak 
Regional information can help to identify background soil, water, and air quality characteristics.unique_linebreak 
In addition, information concerning previous cleanup actions, such as removal of containerized waste, is often valuable for determining the characteristics of any wastes or contaminated media remaining at the site.unique_linebreak 
For example, preliminary treatment costs for contaminated soil can be calculated for various contaminant types and volumes.unique_linebreak 
surface disposal areas, fencing, property lines and utility lines, roadways and railways, drainage ditches, leachate springs, surface-water bodies, vegetation, topography, residences, and commercial buildings.unique_linebreak 
Census and other survey data may be used to identify and describe the population potentially exposed to contaminated media.unique_linebreak 
Leachate from contaminant sources or discharge of contaminated ground water can result in the contamination of surface waters.unique_linebreak 
As with soil, the relative ease of obtaining samples allows many samples to be taken and analyzed using field screening methods, a subset of which can be chosen for more rigorous analysis.unique_linebreak 
A potentially more serious and common problem associated with surface water is the contamination of sediments.unique_linebreak 
Whereas contamination in surface water tends to become diluted or transformed as it travels downstream, contaminants deposited in ‘sediments tend to remain in place.unique_linebreak 
It is therefore important to monitor for sediment contamination if it is suspected that surface water has been contaminated.unique_linebreak 
Volatilization of organics and emissions of airborne particulates can be a concern at hazardous waste sites.unique_linebreak 
For sites at which it appears that air emissions are a problem (e.g., surface impoundments containing volatile organics, landfills at which there is evidence of methane gas production and migration), an air emissions monitoring program should be undertaken.unique_linebreak 
5 Cross-media contamination should be considered (e.g., potential for contaminated soils to act as a source for ground- water contamination due to leaching from the soil).unique_linebreak 
These data are then assessed to yield a value that represents the amount of contaminated media contacted per day.unique_linebreak 
The results of the baseline risk assessment may indicate that the site poses little or no threat to human health or the environment.unique_linebreak 
Also at this stage, the areas and quantities of contaminated media initially specified in the general response actions may also be reevaluated with respect to the effects of interactions between media.unique_linebreak

Following in-situ fixation, the lead-contaminated soil is anticipated to be nonhazardous.unique_linebreak 
The site consists of two areas of contaminated soil: Area 1 is contaminated with lead; Area 2 is contaminated with TCE.unique_linebreak 
The area of contamination referred to as Area 1 contains 25,000 cubic yards (cy) of contaminated soil with concentrations of lead exceeding 200 mg/kg (concentrations of lead reach 500 mg/kg at several locations within this area).unique_linebreak 
Sampling conducted during the RI shows that no existing residential wells are currently contaminated.unique_linebreak 
) has been determined to be a relevant and appropriate remediation level for the contaminated ground water at this site since the ground water is used for drinking water.unique_linebreak 
The risk assessment also concluded that 200 mg/kg for lead in soil would be a protective level for expected site exposures along with a 1 x 1 0 - 6 F - 2unique_linebreak 
However, the lead-contaminated soil is an RCRA hazardous waste by characteristic in this instance due to EP-toxicity.unique_linebreak 
A significant uncertainty that would affect the cost is the actual volumes of contaminated soil and ground water.unique_linebreak 
Failure to address reduction in the cap’s impermeability could result in increased leachate production, subsequent ground water contamination, and the potential for direct contact with the contaminated soil.unique_linebreak 
Because the contaminated soil would remain onsite and because the ground water may remain contaminated above health-based levels for 100 years, long-term monitoring, maintenance, and control would be required under this alternative.unique_linebreak 
It would prevent exposure to the contaminated soil and would minimize further release of contaminants to the ground water by limiting future infiltration through the cap.unique_linebreak 
Soil vapor extraction and the cap over the contaminated soil would reduce risk to human health by direct contact and soil ingestion.unique_linebreak 
contaminated ground water, and reduce the possibility of further environmental degradation.unique_linebreak 
Two offsite wells would be used to remediate the area of the offsite contaminated aquifer.unique_linebreak 
contaminated soil onsite under a soil/clay cap.unique_linebreak 
Further ground water contamination is reduced by removal of TCE through soil vapor extraction.unique_linebreak 
Human health risks posed by ingestion of ground water in the future would be reduced to less than 5   by the pump and treat systems.unique_linebreak 
During operation of the vapor extraction system, the contaminated soil would remain uncovered, although the fence to be installed around the site would discourage trespassers and limit potential exposure.unique_linebreak 
The TCE- contaminated soil in Area 2 would be excavated and treated onsite by a thermal destruction unit.unique_linebreak 
Soil fixation would reduce the mobility of lead by about 40 percent but would increase the volume of contaminated soil from 25,000 cy to about 30,000 cy.unique_linebreak 
The residual soil remaining following treatment would not pose a risk to human health or the environment.unique_linebreak 
would increase the volume of contaminated soil from 25,000 cy to about 30,000 cy.unique_linebreak 
Even in the unlikely event of cap failure in Area 1, the fixed soil would pose little if any risk of ground water contamination.unique_linebreak 
During the vapor extraction process, the contaminated soil would be uncovered and the potential exists for contaminant release into the air (although the risk would be small due to the control system that would be used).unique_linebreak 
In the event that they cannot be delisted due to the presence of metals, either residuals will be managed as part of the closure of Area 2 (lead-contaminated soil).unique_linebreak 
The contaminated ground water would be collected and treated, reducing further the threat of ingesting contaminated ground water.unique_linebreak 
The direct contact risk would be reduced by fixing soil exceeding 200 lead and incinerating TCE-contaminated soil with an excess   cancer risk level greater than 1 x 10 -6.unique_linebreak 
Approximately 18,000 cy of treated soil that would pose minimal risk to human health or the environment would be disposed offsite in the local municipal landfill.unique_linebreak 
It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cy of contaminated soil would need to be excavated and treated.unique_linebreak 
There are still some uncertainties with this volume estimate so it would be necessary to sample during excavation to determine when sufficient material has been removed.unique_linebreak 
The area where soil is removed for incineration would not require long-term monitoring whereas the contaminated soil that is fixed would remain under a cap and would require long-term monitoring and maintenance.unique_linebreak 
While some contaminated soil would remain after implementation of both alternatives, it would be fixed to reduce mobility.unique_linebreak 
Incineration of metal-contaminated soil may result in a hazardous waste residue which would have to be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.unique_linebreak 
Failure to detect a problem with the cap may result in direct contact with the contaminated soil and further degradation of the ground water through leachate production.unique_linebreak 
All of the contaminated soil, controlled by a cap, and all of the contaminated ground water would remain, although the contaminants in the groundwater will naturally attenuate.unique_linebreak 
Approximately 25,000 cy of lead- contaminated soil would remain untreated onsite.unique_linebreak

This report summarizes the results of the field activities to characterize the nature and extent of contamination, the fate and transport of contaminants, and the results of the baseline risk assessment.unique_linebreak 
Field-screening techniques can be useful in defining areas of contamination.unique_linebreak

Potential chemical- and location-specific ARARs are identified on the basis of the compilation and evaluation of existing site data.unique_linebreak 
The transport of contaminants in surface-water bodies is largely controlled by flow, which in streams is a function of the gradient, geometry, and coefficient of friction.unique_linebreak 
Contaminants have three possible modes of transport: (1) sorption onto the sediment carried by the flow, (2) transport as suspended solid, and (3) transport as a solute (dissolved).unique_linebreak 
The transport of dissolved contaminants, which move the fastest, can be determined by characterizing the flow of the surface water and the contaminant dispersion.unique_linebreak 
This determination is especially important for buried drums or tanks, because corrosion may be rapid.unique_linebreak 
In these cases, it is not likely that routine surface water sampling will show contamination that has or may occur.unique_linebreak 
As with ground water, soil contamination should be documented in both vertical and horizontal directions.unique_linebreak 
However, it should be noted that sediment contamination often consists of inorganics and/or nonvolatile organics for which field screening techniques are not as applicable.unique_linebreak 
This analysis should emphasize factors important in determining contaminant fate and transport for those exposure pathways of concern.unique_linebreak 
For example, if migration of contamination in ground water is of concern, these factors may include the properties of the unsaturated zone, the rate and direction of flow in the aquifer(s), and the extent of subsurface systems.unique_linebreak 
Spatial trends in contamination may be important in evaluating transport pathways.unique_linebreak

Contamination can be represented by concentrations in addition to risk levels.unique_linebreak 
Representation of the areal extent of contamination.unique_linebreak 
Contaminants of concern may be selected because of their intrinsic toxicological properties, because they are present in large quantities, or because they are presently in or potentially may move into critical exposure pathways (e.g., drinking water supply).unique_linebreak 
Exposure Assessment The objectives of an exposure assessment are to identify actual or potential exposure pathways, to characterize the potentially exposed populations, and to determine the extent of the exposure.unique_linebreak 
Identifying potential exposure pathways helps to conceptualize how contaminants may migrate from a source to an existing or potential point of contact.unique_linebreak

There is also a ground water plume associated with the site that contains levels of TCE as high as 100 ppb and lead as high as 500 ppb.unique_linebreak 
The exposure pathways of concern identified during the baseline risk assessment include direct contact with possible ingestion of contaminated soil (1 x 1 0 -3 associated excess cancer risk), and potential ingestion of contaminated ground water in the future F-1unique_linebreak 
Although the risk assessment did not identify a human health or environmental risk from these metals, there is a small possibility that hot spots of metal contamination may have been missed.unique_linebreak 
Both direct and indirect costs are considered in the development of capital cost estimates.unique_linebreak 
This cover layer would include 6 inches of topsoil and 3 feet of compacted native soil materials.unique_linebreak 
The vacuum not only draws vapor from the unsaturated zone, but also decreases the pressure around the soil particles, thereby releasing additional volatiles.unique_linebreak 
Because lead is not expected to migrate rapidly, failure of the cap would increase the potential risk through direct contact but pose little or no concern for further ground water contamination.unique_linebreak

RBA of soil arsenic and lead can be expected to range from 0 to 100%.unique_linebreak 
These factors collectively tend to reduce the bioavailability of arsenic.unique_linebreak 
Soil-bound arsenic is usually absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract to a lesser degree than when in more soluble forms.unique_linebreak 
This reduced absorption results from the affinity between arsenic and the soil matrix, the low solubility of the chemical form of arsenic associated with the soil, or both.unique_linebreak 
The bioaccessible fraction of arsenic does not appear to be concentration dependent with respect to total arsenic.unique_linebreak

Site-specific parameters for the dilution factor model include aquifer hydraulic conductivity (K), hydraulic gradient (i), infiltration rate (I), aquifer thickness (d), and source length parallel to ground water flow (L).unique_linebreak

An alternative remedial action will attain an equivalent standard of performance through the use of another method or approach.unique_linebreak 
The remedial action selected is only a part of a total remedial action (interim remedy) and the final remedy will attain the ARAR upon its completion.unique_linebreak 
Section 121 (c) also requires a periodic review of remedial actions, at least every 5 years after initiation of such action, for as long as hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants that may pose a threat to human health or the environment remain at the site.unique_linebreak 
For §104 Superfund-financed remedial actions, compliance with the ARAR will not provide a balance between protecting human health and the environment and the availability of Superfund money for response at other facilities.unique_linebreak 
Section 121 states a strong statutory preference for remedies that are highly reliable and provide long-term protection.unique_linebreak 
In addition to the requirement for remedies to be both protective of human health and the environment and cost- effective, additional remedy selection considerations in 5121(b) include: •• A preference for remedial actions that employ treatment that permanently and significantly reduces the volume, toxicity, or mobility of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants as a principal element • Offsite transport and disposal without treatment is the least favored alternative where practicable treatment technologies are available •• The need to assess the use of permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies and use them to the maximum extent practicable Section 121 (c) also requires a periodic review of remedial actions, at least every 5 years after initiation of such action, for as long as hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants that may pose a threat to human health or the environment remain at the site.unique_linebreak

The RI/FS Process Under CERCLA Although the new provisions of CERCLA have resulted in some modifications to the RI/FS process, the basic components of the process remain intact.unique_linebreak 
The various steps, or phases, of the RI/FS process and how they have been modified to comply with the new provisions in CERCLA are summarized below.unique_linebreak 
It is important to note that the RI and FS are to be conducted concurrently and that data collected in the RI influence the development of remedial alternatives in the FS, which in turn affects the data needs and scope of treatability studies and additional field investigations.unique_linebreak 
Two concepts are essential to the phased RI/FS approach.unique_linebreak 
As a basic understanding of site characteristics is achieved, subsequent data collection efforts focus on filling identified gaps in the understanding of site characteristics and gathering information necessary to evaluate remedial alternatives.unique_linebreak 
Second, this phased sampling approach encourages identification of key data needs as early in the process as possible to ensure that data collection is always directed toward providing information relevant to selection of a remedial action.unique_linebreak 
Because of the interactive and iterative nature of this phase of the RI and FS process, the sequence of the various phases and associated activities, as described below and presented in Figure 1-1, will frequently be less distinct in practice.unique_linebreak 
Chapter 2 describes the various steps in the scoping process and gives general information on work- planning methods that have been effective in planning and executing past RI/FSs.unique_linebreak 
Field sampling should be phased 4 so that the results of the initial sampling efforts can be used to refine plans developed during scoping to better focus subsequent sampling efforts.unique_linebreak 
Emphasis is placed on rapid turnaround of sampling results to avoid the need to remobilize and reprocure contractors.unique_linebreak 
Scoping is the initial planning phase of the RI/FS process, and many of the planning steps begun here are continued and refined in later phases of the RI/FS.unique_linebreak 
technologies based on their effectiveness, implementability, and cost; and (4) assembling technologies and their associated containment or disposal requirements into alternatives for the contaminated media at the site or for the operable unit.unique_linebreak 
Alternatives can be developed to address contaminated medium (e.g., ground water), a specific area of the site (e.g., a waste lagoon or contaminated hot spots), or the entire site.unique_linebreak 
Alternatives for specific media and site areas either can be carried through the FS process separately or combined into comprehensive alternatives for the entire site.unique_linebreak 
The approach is flexible to allow alternatives to be combined at various points in the process.unique_linebreak 
This assessment also serves to support the evaluation of the no-action alternative by documenting the threats posed by the site based on expected exposure scenarios.unique_linebreak 
Because this assessment identifies the primary health and environmental threats at the site, it also provides valuable input to the development and evaluation of alternatives during the FS.unique_linebreak 
The development of alternatives requires (1) identifying remedial action objectives; (2) identifying potential treatment, resource recovery, and containment technologies that will satisfy these objectives; (3) screening the technologies based on their effectiveness, implementability, and cost; and (4) assembling technologies and their associated containment or disposal requirements into alternatives for the contaminated media at the site or for the operable unit.unique_linebreak 
As practicable, a range of treatment alternatives, should be developed, varying primarily in the extent to which they rely on long-term management of residuals and untreated wastes.unique_linebreak 
The upper bound of the range would be an alternative that would eliminate, to the extent feasible, the need for any long-term management (including monitoring) at the site.unique_linebreak 
The lower bound would consist of an alternative that involves treatment as a principal element (i.e., treatment is used to address the principal threats at 1 - 7unique_linebreak 
The results of the detailed analysis are summarized and presented to the decisionmaker so that an appropriate remedy consistent with CERCLA can be selected.unique_linebreak 
Should existing site and/or treatment data be insufficient to adequately evaluate alternatives, treatability tests may be necessary to evaluate a particular technology on specific site wastes.unique_linebreak 
Generally, treatability tests involve bench-scale testing to gather information to assess the feasibility of a technology.unique_linebreak 
In a few situations, a pilot-scale study may be necessary to furnish performance data and develop better cost estimates so that a detailed analysis can be performed and a remedial action can be selected.unique_linebreak 
Treatability investigations are described in Chapter 5.unique_linebreak 
Once sufficient data are available, alternatives are evaluated in detail with respect to nine evaluation criteria that the Agency has developed to address the statutory requirements and preferences of CERCLA.unique_linebreak 
The alternatives are analyzed individually against each criterion and then compared against one another to determine their respective strengths and weaknesses and to identify the key tradeoffs that must be balanced for that site.unique_linebreak 
The use of treatment technologies and, therefore, the development of a complete range of options, may not be practicable at some sites with large volumes of low concentration wastes (e.g., large municipal landfills or mining sites).unique_linebreak 
Therefore, the range of alternatives initially developed may be focused primarily on various containment options.unique_linebreak 
At a minimum, the plan must provide for a site mailing list, a conveniently located place for access to all public information about the site, an opportunity for a public meeting when the RI/FS report and proposed plan are issued, and a summary of public comments on the RI/FS report and proposed plan and the Agency’s response to those comments.unique_linebreak 
Once potential alternatives have been developed, it may be necessary to screen out certain options to reduce the number of alternatives that will be analyzed in detail in order to minimize the resources dedicated to evaluating options that are less promising.unique_linebreak 
The necessity of this screening effort will depend on the number of alternatives initially developed, which will depend partially on the complexity of the site and/ or the number of available, suitable technologies.unique_linebreak 
For situations in which it is necessary to reduce the initial number of alternatives before beginning the detailed analysis, a range of alternatives should be preserved, as practicable, so that the decisionmaker can be presented with a variety of distinct, viable options from which to choose.unique_linebreak 
The screening process involves evaluating alternatives with respect to their effectiveness, implementability, and cost.unique_linebreak 
Between the upper and lower bounds of the treatment range, alternatives varying in the type and degrees of treatment and associated containment/ disposal requirements should be included as appropriate.unique_linebreak 
In addition, one or more containment option(s) involving little or no treatment should be developed as appropriate, and a no-action alternative should always be developed.unique_linebreak 
1.8 Remedial Project Manager Role and Responsibilities The Remedial Project Manager’s (RPM’s) role in overseeing an RI/FS involves, to a large extent, ensuring that the work progresses according to the priorities and objectives established during site management and project planning.unique_linebreak 
Throughout the following chapters, and particularly in the discussions of scoping (Chapter 2) and site characterization (Chapter 3), suggestions are provided to guide the RPM in developing approaches for conducting RI/FSs so that high-quality deliverables are produced in a timely and cost-effective manner.unique_linebreak 
Additional suggestions specific to management of RI/FSs may be found in the Superfund Federal-Lead Remedial Project Management Handbook (U.S. EPA, December 1986) and Superfund State-Lead Remedial Project Management Handbook (U.S. EPA, December 1986).unique_linebreak 
developing cost estimating guides and a reference document for use by RPMs that will provide historical averages for the cost of the various RI/FS tasks.unique_linebreak 
1 2.2 Project Planning Once a general site management approach has been agreed upon, planning can begin for the scope of a specific project.unique_linebreak 
The specific activities conducted during project planning include: 2 Meeting with lead agency, support agency, and contractor personnel to discuss site issues and assign responsibilities for RI/FS activities Collecting and analyzing existing data to develop a conceptual site model that can be used to assess both the nature and the extent of contamination and to identify potential exposure pathways and potential human health and/or environmental receptors Initiating limited field investigations if available data are inadequate to develop a conceptual site model and adequately scope the project Identifying preliminary remedial action objectives and likely response actions for the specific project Preliminarily identifying the ARARs expected to apply to site characterization and site remediation activities Determining data needs and the level of analytical and sampling certainty required for additional data 1 See Appendix A for a delineation of responsibilities between the lead agency and the PRPs during the scoping process.unique_linebreak 
Therefore, it is important to note that the scope of the project and, to some extent the specific project plans, are developed iteratively (i.e., as new information is acquired or new decisions are made, data requirements are reevaluated and, if appropriate, project plans are modified).unique_linebreak 
In this way, scoping helps to focus activities and streamline the RI/FS, thereby preventing needless expenditures and loss of time in unnecessary sampling and analyses.unique_linebreak 
Identify the type and quality of data quality objectives (DQOs) needed to support those decisions Describe the methods by which the required data will be obtained and analyzed Prepare project plans to document methods and procedures The activities described above relate directly to the establishment of DQOs - statements that specify the type and quality of the data needed to support decisions regarding remedial response activities.unique_linebreak 
The establishment of DQOs is discussed in detail in Data Qualify Objectives for Remedial Response Activities (U.S. EPA, March 1987, hereafter referred to as the DQO Guidance).unique_linebreak 
Meeting with lead agency, support agency, and contractor personnel to discuss site issues and assign responsibilities for RI/FS activities Collecting and analyzing existing data to develop a conceptual site model that can be used to assess both the nature and the extent of contamination and to identify potential exposure pathways and potential human health and/or environmental receptors Initiating limited field investigations if available data are inadequate to develop a conceptual site model and adequately scope the project Identifying preliminary remedial action objectives and likely response actions for the specific project Preliminarily identifying the ARARs expected to apply to site characterization and site remediation activities Determining data needs and the level of analytical and sampling certainty required for additional data 1 See Appendix A for a delineation of responsibilities between the lead agency and the PRPs during the scoping process.unique_linebreak

The expanded site investigation (ESI) conducted by the pre- remedial program will provide valuable data (e.g., geophysics, surveys, well inventories) and should serve as an important source of information during the scoping process for establishing the hypotheses to be tested concerning the nature and extent of contamination.unique_linebreak 
Once the available data have been collected, they are analyzed to (1) establish the physical characteristics of a site to help determine the scope of future sampling efforts; and (2) conceptually model potential exposure pathways and receptors to assist in the preliminary assessment of risk and the initial identification of potential remedial technologies.unique_linebreak 
This effort, in addition to assisting in identifying locations where sampling is necessary, will also assist in the identification of potential remedial technologies.unique_linebreak 
Establish Physical Characteristics of the Site The analysis of existing data serves to’ provide a better understanding of the nature and extent of contamination and aids in the design of remedial investigation tasks.unique_linebreak 
2.2.2.2 Develop a Conceptual Site Model Information on the waste sources, pathways, and receptors at a site is used to develop a conceptual understanding of the site to evaluate potential risks to human health and the environment.unique_linebreak 
Examples of tasks are as follows: Preliminary geophysical investigations Residential, industrial, and agricultural well sampling and analysis Measurement of well-water level, sampling (only for pre-existing monitoring wells), and analysis Limited sampling to determine the need for waste treatability studies Air monitoring Site mapping Preliminary ecological reconnaissance 2.2.3 Develop Preliminary Remedial Action AIternatives Once the existing site information has been analyzed and a conceptual understanding of the site is obtained, potential remedial action objectives should be identified for each contaminated medium (Chapter 4 presents examples of remedial action objectives) and a preliminary range of remedial action alternatives and associated technologies should be identified.unique_linebreak

Once the existing site information has been analyzed and a conceptual understanding of the site is obtained, potential remedial action objectives should be identified for each contaminated medium (Chapter 4 presents examples of remedial action objectives) and a preliminary range of remedial action alternatives and associated technologies should be identified.unique_linebreak 
If remedial actions involving treatment have been identified for a site, then the need for treatability studies should be evaluated as early as possible in the RI/FS process.unique_linebreak 
Other federal and state criteria, advisories, and guidance and local ordinances should also be considered, as appropriate, in the development of remedial action alternatives.unique_linebreak 
A preliminary identification of potential ARARs and TBC information in the scoping phase can assist in initially identifying remedial alternatives and is useful for initiating communications with the support agency to facilitate the identification of ARARs.unique_linebreak 
Because of the iterative nature of the RI/FS process, ARAR identification continues throughout the RI/FS as a better understanding is gained of site conditions, site contaminants, and remedial action alternatives.unique_linebreak 
The initial activities of treatability testing include researching other potentially applicable data, designing the study, and procuring vendors and equipment.unique_linebreak 
As appropriate, these activities should occur concurrently with site characterization efforts so that if it is determined that a potential technology is not feasible, planned treatability activities for this technology can be terminated.unique_linebreak

Offsite disposal facilities receiving contaminants must be in compliance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and other Federal and State laws.unique_linebreak 
Registry (ATSDR) must conduct a health assessment for every site proposed for inclusion on the NPL.unique_linebreak 
The purpose of these health assessments is to assist in determining whether current or potential risk to human health exists at a site and whether additional information on human exposure and associated health risks is needed.unique_linebreak 
Detailed guidance on PRP oversight is currently under preparation in the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER).unique_linebreak 
A preliminary site characterization summary is prepared to provide the lead agency with information on the site early in the process before preparation of the full RI report.unique_linebreak 
On the basis of this information, site management planning is undertaken to preliminarily identify boundaries of the study area, identify likely remedial action objectives and whether interim actions may be necessary or appropriate, and to establish whether the site may best be remedied as one or several separate operable units.unique_linebreak 
Once an overall management strategy is agreed upon, the RI/FS for a specific project or the site as a whole is planned.unique_linebreak 
The RI continues to serve as the mechanism for collecting data to characterize site conditions; determine the nature of the waste; assess risk to human health and the environment; and conduct treatability testing as necessary to evaluate the potential performance and cost of the treatment technologies that are being considered.unique_linebreak 
First, data should generally be collected in several stages, with initial data collection efforts usually limited to developing a general understanding of the site.unique_linebreak 
Data quality objectives are revised as appropriate based on an improved understanding of the site to facilitate a more efficient and accurate characterization of the site and, therefore, achieve reductions in time and cost.unique_linebreak 
A baseline risk assessment is developed to identify the existing or potential risks that may be posed to human health and the environment by the site.unique_linebreak 
To conduct a pilot-scale test and keep the RI/FS on schedule, it will usually be necessary to identify and initiate the test at an early point in the process.unique_linebreak 
A community relations plan is developed for a site as the work plan for the RI/FS is prepared.unique_linebreak 
The specific community relations requirements for each phase of the RI/FS are integrated throughout this guidance document since they are parallel to and support the technical activities.unique_linebreak 
Each chapter of this guidance has a section discussing community relations requirements appropriate to that specific phase of the RI/FS.unique_linebreak 
long-term management of portions of the site that did not constitute “principal threats” would be required.unique_linebreak

Determining data needs and the level of analytical and sampling certainty required for additional data 1 See Appendix A for a delineation of responsibilities between the lead agency and the PRPs during the scoping process.unique_linebreak 
Once a general site management approach has been agreed upon, planning can begin for the scope of a specific project.unique_linebreak 
The lead and support agencies should meet and, on the basis of available information, begin to (1) identify the types of actions that may be required to address site problems; (2) identify whether interim actions are necessary or appropriate to mitigate potential threats, prevent further environmental degradation, or rapidly reduce risks significantly, and (3) identify the optimal sequence of site actions and investigative activities.unique_linebreak 
to focus activities and streamline the RI/FS, thereby preventing needless expenditures and loss of time in unnecessary sampling and analyses.unique_linebreak 
Once the lead and support agencies initially agree on a general approach for managing the site, the next step is to scope the project(s) and develop specific project plans.unique_linebreak 
These data can be used to determine the additional work that needs to be conducted both in the field and within the community.unique_linebreak 
A thorough search of existing data should help avoid duplication of previous efforts and lead to a remedial investigation that is more focused and, therefore, more efficient in its expenditure of resources.unique_linebreak

Available results from any previous biological testing should be compiled to document 3 The expanded site investigation (ESI) conducted by the pre- remedial program will provide valuable data (e.g., geophysics, surveys, well inventories) and should serve as an important source of information during the scoping process for establishing the hypotheses to be tested concerning the nature and extent of contamination.unique_linebreak 
A summary of existing site-specific and regional information should be compiled to help identify surface, subsurface, atmospheric, and biotic migration pathways.unique_linebreak 
Residential, municipal, or industrial wells should be located, and surface water uses should be identified for surrounding areas and areas downstream of the site.unique_linebreak 
Data relating to the varieties and quantities of hazardous wastes disposed of at the site should be compiled.unique_linebreak 
Results of environmental sampling at the site should be summarized, and evidence of soil, ground water, surface water, sediment, air, or biotic contamination should be documented.unique_linebreak 
Existing data should be used to develop a site description, which should include location, ownership, topography, geology, land use, waste type, estimates of waste volume, and other pertinent details.unique_linebreak 
All sources of information or data should be summarized in a technical memorandum or retained for inclusion in the RI report.unique_linebreak 
If quality assurance information on existing sampling data is available, it should be reviewed to assess the level of uncertainty associated with the data.unique_linebreak 
Existing data should be used to develop a site description, which should include location, ownership, topography, geology, land use, waste type, estimates of waste volume, and other pertinent details.unique_linebreak 
5 The specific procedures for initiating limited field investigation will be dependent on the lead agency’s administrative and contractual requirements.unique_linebreak 
If the conceptual understanding of a site is poor and the collection of site-specific data would greatly enhance the scoping effort, a limited field investigation may be undertaken as an interim scoping task prior to developing the work plan.unique_linebreak 
Data needs are identified by evaluating the existing data and determining what additional data are necessary to characterize the site, develop a better conceptual understanding of the site, 6 In addition, compliance with certain environmental statutes (e.g., the National Historic Preservation Act) is simplified by early consultation with the responsible Federal agency.unique_linebreak 
ARARs may be categorized as chemical-specific requirements that may define acceptable exposure levels and therefore be used in establishing preliminary remediation goals; as location-specific requirements that may set restrictions on activities within specific locations such as floodplains or wetlands; and as action-specific, which may set controls or restrictions for particular treatment and disposal activities related to the management of hazardous wastes.unique_linebreak 
Critical parameters in any of the use categories can be varied over a probable range of values that were identified in the conceptual site model and that determine the effect on meeting the RI/FS objectives.unique_linebreak 
Support future enforcement or cost-recovery activities If additional data are needed, the intended uses of the data are identified, strategies for sampling and analyses are developed, DQOs are established, and priorities are assigned according to the importance of the data in meeting the objectives of the RI/FS.unique_linebreak 
The need for additional site data is evaluated relative to meeting the site-specific RI/FS objectives.unique_linebreak 
If information is lacking, descriptions of potential evaluation techniques could be included, and in addition to describing site characterization techniques, methods to be used in the risk assessment also should be described.unique_linebreak 
Tasks to be conducted during the RI/FS should be identified and documented in a work plan.unique_linebreak 
As the RI/FS process progresses and a better understanding of the site is gained, these task descriptions can be refined.unique_linebreak 
The lead agency will determine on a site-specific basis the type and number of interviews that need to be conducted to obtain sufficient information to develop an effective community relations plan.unique_linebreak 
On the basis of an understanding of the issues and concerns of the community, the community relations history, and the citizens’ indicated preferences for how they would like to be informed concerning site activities, the community relations plan is prepared.unique_linebreak 
Plans should provide opportunities for public input throughout the remedial planning process as appropriate.unique_linebreak 
It is especially important that discussion and information exchange occur if interim actions or limited field investigations are considered necessary.unique_linebreak 
For all RI/FSs, it is desirable for the lead and support agencies and their contractors to review existing data and to agree on the major tasks to be conducted at a site.unique_linebreak

Coordination among the lead agency, the support agency, the PRPs and the contractors performing the work    Coordination with other agencies (Typically, the lead agency’s RPM is the focus for the coordination of all other agency and private participation in site activities and decisions.)unique_linebreak 
The initial work plan is prepared prior to the RI site characterization.unique_linebreak 
Later tasks will usually be scoped in less detail, pending the acquisition of more complete data about the site.unique_linebreak 
The work plan documents the decision and evaluation made during the scoping process and presents anticipated future tasks.unique_linebreak 
The work plan also defines the scope and objectives of RI/FS activities to the extent possible.unique_linebreak 
The work plan should be revised, if necessary, before (1) additional iterations of site characterization activities, and (2) treatability investigations.unique_linebreak

2.3.3.2 Elements of the Health and Safety Plan Each site health and safety plan should include, at a minimum, the 11 elements described in Appendix B of this guidance.unique_linebreak 
The specific information required in a site health and safety plan is listed in 29 CFR 1910.120.unique_linebreak 
The site health and safety plan should be prepared concurrently with the SAP to identify potential problems early, such as the availability of adequately trained personnel and equipment.unique_linebreak 
OSHA requires that the plan include maps and a detailed site description, results of previous sampling activities, and field reports.unique_linebreak 
The plan preparer should review site information, along with proposed activities, and use professional judgment to identify potentially hazardous operations and exposures and prescribe appropriate protective measures.unique_linebreak 
The final component of site health and safety planning or informational programs is site auditing to evaluate compliance with and effectiveness of the site health and safety plan.unique_linebreak 
The site health and safety officer or that person’s designee should carry out the inspections.unique_linebreak 
Each site health and safety plan should include, at a minimum, the 11 elements described in Appendix B of this guidance.unique_linebreak 
At this time, it is usually apparent whether the data needs identified during project planning were adequate and whether those needs were satisfied by the first round of field sampling.unique_linebreak 
These additional studies, if needed, can be conducted during subsequent site characterization activities.unique_linebreak 
Because information on a site can be limited prior to conducting an RI, it may be desirable to conduct two or more iterative field investigations so that sampling efforts can be better focused.unique_linebreak 
Field investigation methods used in Rls are selected to meet the data needs established in the scoping process and outlined in the work plan and SAP.unique_linebreak 
This section provides an overview of the type of site characterization data that may be required and the investigative methods used in obtaining these data.unique_linebreak 
Coordinate with analytical laboratories, including sample scheduling, sample bottle acquisition reporting, chain-of-custody records, and procurement of close support laboratories or other in-field analytical capabilities Procure onsite facilities for office and laboratory space, decontamination equipment, and vehicle 3 - 3unique_linebreak 
Assure that access to the site and any other areas to be investigated has been obtained Procure subcontractors such as drillers, excavators, surveyors, and geophysicists Procure equipment (personal protective ensembles, air monitoring devices, sampling equipment, decontamination apparatus) and supplies (disposables, tape, notebook, etc.)unique_linebreak 
Data on the physical characteristics of the site and surrounding areas should be collected to the extent necessary to define potential transport pathways and receptor populations and to provide sufficient engineering data for development and screening of remedial action alternatives.unique_linebreak 
If such quick-turnaround analysis is available, it can be used to determine the location and type of subsequent sampling that must take place to more completely characterize the site.unique_linebreak 
If such analytical techniques are to be employed, the work plan and SAP should allow for decisions on subsequent activities to be made in the field with oral approval from key management personnel.unique_linebreak 
Since procurement activities can take up to several months, they should be initiated as early as possible so as not to affect the overall RI/FS schedule.unique_linebreak 
Schedule impacts should also be avoided by structuring contracts, where possible, such that there is no need to reprocure services for subsequent site characterization activities.unique_linebreak

Over the RBA range of 1 to 100%, adjustments of the EPC or AL to account for RBA will be less than a factor of 100, and decisions about contaminant concentrations (removal, remediation, control) that are more than 100 times the AL may not be appreciably affected by RBA assessments.unique_linebreak

Consistent with reporting convention used by MassDEP drinking water program, only detections greater than the detection limit (or 0.002 µg/L for AFCEC data) are included in the PFAS6 summation.unique_linebreak 
However, it must be kept in mind that a weighted or unweighted estimate of a site-wide RBA (e.g., weighted mean) may over- or underestimate RBA at any given decision unit and, as a result, there will be lower confidence in the resulting adjusted EPC or adjusted AL for the decision unit if adjusted by a site-wide RBA.unique_linebreak 
A site-wide RBA may be estimated to simplify risk assessment calculations at sites where RBA is found be (or is assumed to be) homogenous across decision units.unique_linebreak

The method used to estimate a site- wide RBA will depend on the DQO and the conceptual site model (i.e., how well decision units represent the site), as well as the distribution of observed RBAs in the decision unit.unique_linebreak

 CERCLA Remedy Selection Criteria (continued): Five balancing criteria (used to evaluate between potential remedies that meet threshold criteria)unique_linebreak 
If a site-wide RBA is to be used to assess risk at the decision unit level, and exposure is not random across the site, then some form of spatial or activity weighting of the decision units should be considered in the calculation of a site-wide RBA.unique_linebreak 
RBA-adjusted concentration: Concentration of contaminant in soil after adjustment for RBA; distinguished from the unadjusted or total concentration of the contaminant in soil.unique_linebreak 
Consistent with reporting convention used by MassDEP drinking water program, only detections greater than 0.002 µg/L are included in the PFAS6 summation.unique_linebreak 
For example, if the DQO is to estimate a site-wide RBA, selection of soils based on concentration may bias the site-wide estimate if some areas are sampled much less densely than others.unique_linebreak 
As sampling results for PFOS and PFOA show exceedances of the EPA lifetime HA in drinking water wells with the same hydrogeological conditions as the drinking water wells that exceed the PFAS6 MMCL but are below the EPA lifetime HA, there are sufficient grounds to find that an imminent and substantial danger to human health may exist.unique_linebreak 
These criteria are assessed following comment on the RI/FS report and the proposed plan.unique_linebreak 
The resulting value for RBA to be assumed in the risk assessment is then converted to a corresponding value for AFPsoil in the IEUBK model.unique_linebreak 
In some circumstances, it may be prudent to consider statistics other than the mean (or 95UCL) to represent the RBA [see Attachment E (Retrospective Relative Bioavailability Assessment in Support of a Removal Decision: A Case Study)].unique_linebreak

The amounts should be set pursuant to the criteria of Section 109 and as such must take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violations as well as the PRPs’ ability to pay, prior history of violations, degree of culpability, and the economic benefit resulting from noncompliance.unique_linebreak

MEC Hazard Assessment (HA) Section 2.8 Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs)addressing MEC and establishing cleanup criteria Section 2.9 How MEC source materials constituting principal threats will be addressed.unique_linebreak 
The adjustment was as follows: adjusted DI = DI × RBA (fraction) where DI is the daily oral intake of arsenic in soil (mg/kg/day).unique_linebreak 
In this context, the EPC representing exposure within the decision unit should be the average concentration in the decision unit, estimated as the arithmetic mean or the 95UCL of the mean.unique_linebreak 
The overall assessment of protection draws on the assessments conducted under other evaluation criteria, especially long-term effectiveness and permanence, short-term effectiveness, and compliance with ARARs.unique_linebreak 
After an appropriate blood lead level had been selected (8 μg/dL), the average site-specific AFPsoil was used in the IEUBK model to derive an RBA-adjusted risk-based concentration (see Figure F-2).unique_linebreak

The cleanup levels for soil are shown in Table 1A, below, which has been extracted from Table L-1 of the ROD.unique_linebreak 
Once adjustments have been applied to the AFPsoil parameter, the model will predict a site-specific risk-based soil lead concentration that reflects the site-specific RBA of soil lead.unique_linebreak

The impact of mechanisation on wages and employment: Evidence from the diffusion of steam power

Leonardo Ridolfi, Carla Salvo, Jacob Weisdorf

Fears about the effects of mechanisation on societies are not new; technology has always generated cultural anxiety throughout history.unique_linebreak 
This column considers one of the most significant waves of mechanisation in history – the rise and spread of steam power in 19th century France – to examine the influence of mechanisation on labour outcomes.unique_linebreak 
Rather than cutting jobs and wages, the authors find that that steam-adopting industries ended up employing up to 94% more workers than their non-steam-adopting counterparts and paid wages that were up to 5% higher on average.unique_linebreak 
Recent advances in technology have sparked a heated debate about the effects of mechanisation on current societies.unique_linebreak 
A recurring concern expressed by many commentators is that machines will take over tasks previously performed by workers, leading to widespread unemployment and growing inequality.unique_linebreak 
These mounting fears are not new; technology has always generated cultural anxiety throughout history (Mokyr et al.unique_linebreak 
The path of transition, however, may not be disruptive for all workers and industries.unique_linebreak 
Prominent economists like Adam Smith, for instance, have long emphasised the positive effects of technology arguing that mechanisation will generate significant productivity gains in the long run, leading to cheaper goods, increased labour demand, and thus more jobs.unique_linebreak 
On balance, the net impact of mechanisation on workers and wages is thus ambiguous depending on how the displacement and productivity effects end up weighing against each other (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018, Autor and Salomons 2018, Atack et al.unique_linebreak 
2019, Frey 2019, Hötte et al 2022).unique_linebreak 
Understanding the effects of mechanisation entails difficult measurement problems because waves of contemporary mechanisation typically overlap, making it difficult to isolate the effect of a specific technology.unique_linebreak

MARKET TRENDS

Drivers: Rapid Infrastructure Development Increasing the Demand for Heavy Equipment

The infrastructure and construction industry is essential for the overall economic growth of the world.unique_linebreak 
Adequate infrastructures such as road and railway transport systems, ports, power, and airports are needed to integrate the country's economy with other world economies.unique_linebreak 
In recent years infrastructure development has grown substantially across the globe, and due to this, the demand for heavy equipment has increased.unique_linebreak 
Generally, heavy equipment refers to heavy-duty vehicles used for construction and mining work; therefore increase in heavy equipment will ultimately increase the demand for engine oil.unique_linebreak 
In addition, emerging countries have taken advantage of foreign direct investment and helped MNCs build various infrastructure and construction projects in multiple countries.unique_linebreak 
Also, new industrial policies implemented by governments of emerging economies helped increase the production capacity of heavy equipment vehicles.unique_linebreak 
The infrastructure and construction industry has shown rapid growth worldwide because of low-cost raw materials, low cost of skilled labor, and increased foreign direct investment (FDI).unique_linebreak 
Opportunities: Increasing Demand for Good Quality Engine Oil due to Stringent Emission Regulation

Governments across the globe have been creating awareness about the negative impacts of greenhouse gas emissions; because of that, various environmental agencies are working closely with governments of multiple countries.unique_linebreak 
As a result, various governments worldwide have laid down stringent emission regulations for vehicles to reduce their environmental impact.unique_linebreak 
Therefore, many manufacturers have taken these regulations as an opportunity to invest in R&D so that they can develop products that will follow these emission regulations and deliver the better performance of the engine.unique_linebreak 
In addition, countries like India, China, US, Germany, UK, and France have laid down emission norms that will decrease fuel consumption and offer better performance.unique_linebreak 
All the above points will increase the demand for good quality engine oil.unique_linebreak 
Various automobile manufacturers such as Ford (US), Mazda (Japan), McLaren (UK), Toyota (Japan), and Porsche (Germany) have formed a strategic partnerships with various manufacturers such as Shell PLC (UK), ExxonMobil (US), and Gulf Oil (US) to develop engine oils compatible for modern engines which follows the emission regulations.unique_linebreak 
Also, the developments in engine design, engine assembly, piston design, and crankshaft systems have created an opportunity for engine oil manufacturers to develop high-performing and efficiency-driven engine oils.unique_linebreak 
Challenges: Constant Fluctuation in Crude Oil Prices

Crude oil is one of the most critical factors influencing international economic development because crude oil products are used in practically every machine.unique_linebreak 
The transportation sector throughout the world is entirely reliant on petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel fuel.unique_linebreak 
Also, different types of lubricants are used for the well functioning of transport vehicles.unique_linebreak 
In addition, many countries also rely extensively on petroleum fuels to heat their homes, cook their food, and generate power.unique_linebreak 
Petroleum products derived from crude oil and other hydrocarbon liquids account for approximately one-third of global energy use.unique_linebreak 
Volatile oil prices have the potential to send shockwaves throughout the global economy.unique_linebreak 
Changes also influence oil prices in supply and demand.unique_linebreak 
Oil is a necessity and is in high demand; market forces primarily determine its price.unique_linebreak 
As crude oil is the primary raw material required to manufacture base oil, engine oil consists of 80% to 90% of base oil, and constant fluctuations in crude oil prices affect engine oil prices.unique_linebreak 
SEGMENT REVIEW

Automotive engine oil is the most commonly used lubricant in vehicles.unique_linebreak 
The automotive engine oil market occupied almost 75% of the global engine oil market share in 2021.unique_linebreak 
The automotive engine oil market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 5% from 2022 to 2027.unique_linebreak 
Engine oil plays a vital role in engine performance, protecting against wear and tear of moving parts.unique_linebreak 
Engine oil consists of base oils and various additives, giving a broad spectrum of properties.unique_linebreak 
Global engine oil products are broadly used in various industries such as automotive & transportation, heavy equipment, power generation, agriculture, woodworking, textile, and others.unique_linebreak 
Engine oil is generally available in three oil types: fully synthetic, semi-synthetic, and mineral oil.unique_linebreak 
All three oil types have some advantages, but semi-synthetic engine oil is the largest oil type segment in the market.unique_linebreak 
Semi-synthetic oils are a mixture of mineral oils and fully synthetic lubricants.unique_linebreak 
Semi-synthetic oil is more expensive than mineral oil but less expensive than fully synthetic oil, which helps consumers to get premium quality engine oil at an economical price.unique_linebreak 
Semi-synthetic oils offer similar properties to fully synthetic, such as increased engine performance, excellent parts protection, and optimized performance.unique_linebreak 
The global engine oil market is diverse.unique_linebreak 
APAC is the leading market for engine oil because of the low cost of labor and abundant availability of raw materials.unique_linebreak 
APAC will dominate the market through the forecast period.unique_linebreak 
However, there are many countries with a high scope for expansion that will challenge the dominance of APAC.unique_linebreak 
COMPANY AND STRATEGIES

The key players have undertaken various strategies to grow in the engine oil market.unique_linebreak 
Companies in the industry compete strategically.unique_linebreak 
The growth in sustainable processes and initiative has been a challenge for all companies globally.unique_linebreak 
Investments in R&D, technological advancement, and environmental and economic difficulties drive the demand for innovative and sustainable engine oil products.unique_linebreak 
Some major players in the market include Exxon Mobil Corporation (US), British Petroleum (UK), Shell (UK), Gulf Oil (US), Idemitsu (Japan), Castrol (US), Fuchs (Germany), and Chevron Corporation (US).unique_linebreak 
These players have adopted strategies such as expansion, acquisitions, new product development, joint ventures, and others to increase their revenues in the engine oil market.unique_linebreak 
The companies are also working to bring a joint fuel-cell electric propulsion system to the market

Hyundai and Rolls-Royce have announced they will work together to bring all-electric propulsion and fuel cell tech to air taxis of the future.unique_linebreak 
The Korean automaker and British aviation company – a separate entity from the manufacturer of ultra-luxury cars with the same name – have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to collaborate in the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Regional Air Mobility (RAM) markets.unique_linebreak 
The partnership was announced at the Farnborough Air Show in Hampshire, England with the MOU detailing several key aims, including collaboration on the development of power and propulsion systems for Hyundai’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) division; collaboration on the industrialization of Rolls-Royce power and propulsion systems for the AAM market; and development of electric propulsion systems based on hydrogen fuel cells as an energy source for Hyundai’s RAM platforms.unique_linebreak 
Perhaps the most intriguing element, however, is the intention to bring a joint fuel-cell electric propulsion system to the wider AAM market, with a commitment to demo an aircraft featuring the tech by 2025.unique_linebreak 
Using a hydrogen fuel cell system in an all-electric aircraft propulsion system holds appeal because it is a zero emission, and silent on-board power source that enables scalability and delivers long-distance flight range.unique_linebreak 
Hyundai has been one of the major advocates of hydrogen fuel cell tech in the automotive world and in 2013 was the first automaker to mass produce a fuel cell electric vehicle with the ix35 FCEV, also known as the Tucson FCEV in some countries.unique_linebreak 
It currently offers the Nexo fuel cell SUV in selected markets.unique_linebreak 
It has made no secret of its desire to become a major player in AAM, and earlier this year confirmed that a mammoth $5 billion investment in the U.S. would include additional research in this area.unique_linebreak 
In addition, at the Farnborough show the group’s air mobility company Supernal showed off an eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) concept that was clearly influenced by automotive design.unique_linebreak 
Supernal is aiming to launch commercial services for UAM businesses in U.S. cities by 2028.unique_linebreak
